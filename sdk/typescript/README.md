# `@openai/codex-security`

Run Codex Security scans from TypeScript or the command line. This ESM-only
package includes TypeScript declarations and the Codex runtime.

Before version `1.0.0`, minor releases may change the public API.

## Install

```bash
npm install @openai/codex-security
npx @openai/codex-security --version
```

Use Node.js 22.13.0+ (22.x), 24.x, or 26.x on macOS, Linux, or Windows.
Policy drafting, scans, exports, scan history, and saved findings also need Python 3.10+
(plus `tomli` on Python 3.10).

## Run a scan from TypeScript

Sign in with `npx @openai/codex-security login` or set `OPENAI_API_KEY` or
`CODEX_API_KEY`, then scan a repository you own or have permission to assess:

```ts
import { CodexSecurity } from "@openai/codex-security";

const security = new CodexSecurity();

try {
  const result = await security.run("/path/to/repository", {
    outputDir: "/path/outside/repository/results",
  });

  console.log(result.reportPath);
  console.log(result.findings.findings.length);
} finally {
  await security.close();
}
```

`result.findings` contains this scan's findings; `repositoryFindings` also
includes earlier open findings when available. Matching earlier findings can
make extra model calls; see [Progress and cost](#progress-and-cost).

Keep results outside the repository and restrict access: reports can contain
source code, vulnerability details, and reproduction steps.

### Validate an existing finding

```ts
const security = new CodexSecurity();
try {
  const result = await security.validate({
    repositoryPath: "/path/to/repository",
    finding: {
      title: "Possible SQL injection",
      location: "src/query.ts:42",
    },
    outputDir: "/path/outside/repository/validation",
  });
  console.log(result.disposition);
  console.log(result.report);
} finally {
  await security.close();
}
```

Pass literal text or a JSON-serializable object as `finding`, not a file path.
Validation uses the client's settings and credentials without changing
repository files or adding a scan to history.

To disable Codex usage analytics and built-in metrics, create the client with
`new CodexSecurity({ codexOverrides: { analytics: { enabled: false } } })`.
This setting also applies to scans run by the same client.

Results include `disposition` (`reportable`, `suppressed`, `not_applicable`,
or `deferred`), a Markdown `report`, `threadId`, and evidence `outputDir`.
`reportable` may rely on static analysis; `deferred` means insufficient evidence.
Failed, incomplete, or malformed responses reject the promise.

`outputDir` must be empty and outside the Git worktree; it defaults to
`validations/` under the state directory. Pass `auth` to select credentials
or `signal` to cancel.

### Import GitHub code scanning alerts

Import alerts, including third-party SARIF uploads, and validate them against
the matching local checkout:

```ts
import {
  CodexSecurity,
  importGitHubCodeScanningAlerts,
} from "@openai/codex-security";

const findings = await importGitHubCodeScanningAlerts({
  repository: "example/repository",
  alertNumbers: [12, 18], // Omit to list all open alerts on the default branch.
  githubToken: process.env["GH_TOKEN"],
});

const security = new CodexSecurity();
try {
  for (const finding of findings) {
    const result = await security.validate({
      repositoryPath: "/path/to/repository",
      finding,
    });
    console.log(finding.url, result.disposition, result.outputDir);
  }
} finally {
  await security.close();
}
```

Each result contains `source`, `repository`, `number`, `url`, and the full
upstream `alert`. Import is read-only and does not start Codex or check out code.

Without `alertNumbers`, `state` filters alerts and defaults to `"open"`.
It also accepts `"closed"`, `"dismissed"`, `"fixed"`, and `"all"`. Exact alert
numbers ignore state and reject a nondefault `state`. Use `ref` for another
branch or pull-request reference.

Supply `githubToken` or use your `gh auth token` credentials, including GitHub
CLI token environment variables. `githubHost` defaults to `GH_HOST` or
`github.com`. The token needs read access to code scanning alerts; access
failures reject the import. Pass `signal` to cancel.

### SDK configuration and scan options

Constructor options:

| Option           | Description                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pluginPath`     | Plugin directory or ZIP; defaults to the bundled plugin.                |
| `pythonPath`     | Python interpreter; overrides `PYTHON`.                                 |
| `codexOverrides` | Supported settings to deep-merge into the isolated Codex configuration. |

Options for `security.run(repository, options)` and
`security.preflight(repository, options)`:

| Option                                      | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth`                                      | Credential source: `"auto"`, `"chatgpt"`, or `"api-key"`.                           |
| `safetyIdentifier`                          | Stable hashed end-user ID for model requests; requires API-key authentication.      |
| `target`                                    | Repository, repository-relative paths, committed diff, or working-tree diff.        |
| `mode`                                      | `"standard"` or `"deep"`; deep mode supports repositories and paths.                |
| `knowledgeBasePaths`                        | Architecture documents, security policies, threat models, or directories.           |
| `scanPrompt` / `scanPromptFile`             | Additional scan instructions as text or a local file.                               |
| `validationPrompt` / `validationPromptFile` | Custom validation instructions as text or a local file; not Deep.                   |
| `postScanPrompt` / `postScanPromptFile`     | Follow-up instructions as text or a local file.                                     |
| `outputDir`                                 | Artifact directory outside the enclosing Git worktree.                              |
| `archiveExisting`                           | Archive existing results in `outputDir` before scanning.                            |
| `maxCostUsd`                                | Stop when estimated model cost exceeds this positive USD amount.                    |
| `stopAfterConsecutiveErrors`                | Stop deep discovery after this many consecutive errors (default: 3).                |
| `maxTimeHours`                              | Deep-scan discovery limit in hours: greater than zero, up to 96.                    |
| `failureSeverity`                           | Severity threshold recorded in the recipe; the SDK caller decides how to handle it. |
| `parentScanId`                              | Parent scan ID for a rerun.                                                         |
| `expectedPluginVersion`                     | Required original plugin version when replaying a scan.                             |
| `signal`                                    | `AbortSignal` to cancel a scan.                                                     |

Follow scans with `onWorkerStatus` and `onReconnect`. `onSessionEvent` receives
saved events with thread IDs and worker numbers. Deep scans can additionally use
`onDeepProgress` for durable independent-review counts: `completed`, `active`,
and `maximum`. The maximum is a configured cap, not a percentage denominator.
`ScanOptions` lists all callbacks.

`preflight` and CLI `--dry-run` check local inputs without starting Codex or
using the network. They don't authenticate, verify model access, resolve Python,
inspect the plugin, or run scan-lifecycle callbacks. Dry runs print effective settings.
Deep preflight includes all six resolved deep settings and their origins in
`deepScanSources`. Applicable legacy deep configuration is validated during
preflight rather than after runtime startup.

`ScanSettings` is the shared settings type. `ScanOptions` adds callbacks,
cancellation, workflow, and runtime controls. Load the same project file used by
`scan -c` through the SDK:

```ts
import { CodexSecurity, loadProjectConfig } from "@openai/codex-security";

const { config, options } = await loadProjectConfig("codex-security.yaml");
await using security = new CodexSecurity(config);
const result = await security.run(repository, options);
if (
  options.failureSeverity !== undefined &&
  result.hasFindingsAtOrAbove(options.failureSeverity)
) {
  process.exitCode = 1;
}
```

`resolveProjectConfig(input, directory?)` accepts a typed `ProjectConfigInput`
object with the same `snake_case` keys as YAML/JSON and returns the same `{ config,
options }` pair and an immutable `sources` map. Resolved context, prompt, and output
paths have the `AbsolutePath` type. `loadProjectConfig(file, directory?)` resolves the selected file
from `directory`, which defaults to the current directory; paths inside the file
are relative to that file. Object paths are relative to the supplied directory.
Scope paths remain relative to the selected repository. Neither helper starts a
scan, reads prompt contents, or discovers another configuration file. `preflight`
and `run` apply the existing local checks and remaining legacy deep defaults.
Project-file keys follow Codex's configuration convention; SDK options keep their
existing `camelCase` names, and CLI flags keep `kebab-case`.

Override resolved SDK options with `{ ...options, maxCostUsd: 5 }`, or add
callbacks there. Direct SDK prompt-file paths use the current directory; inline
text takes precedence over its matching file. Files use the same regular-file
protections as the CLI. The SDK records `failureSeverity` without throwing or
changing process status. `hasFindingsAtOrAbove()` uses the CLI's severity ordering
and leaves the findings unchanged.

## Authentication

Sign in with ChatGPT:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security login
npx @openai/codex-security scan .
```

Use device authentication on remote or headless machines:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security login --device-auth
```

For CI, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_API_KEY`. To save a key, pass it on stdin:

```bash
printenv OPENAI_API_KEY | npx @openai/codex-security login --with-api-key
```

Environment API keys apply to the current command; only `login --with-api-key`
saves them. Pass Codex access tokens on stdin to `login --with-access-token`.
Access-token environment variables are not scan API keys.

SDK callers can select native command authentication through
`codexOverrides.model_providers.<id>.auth` and `model_provider` (including a
selected `profile`). Scans, comparisons, and deduplication reviews preserve
that selection without requiring an API key or replacing it with a stored
login. Codex executes the helper and renews its token. Helper paths and relative
`auth.cwd` values resolve from the supplied `CODEX_HOME` (default `~/.codex`),
not the source checkout; an absolute `auth.cwd` is preserved. Comparisons and
reviews also honor the selected command provider in that home's `config.toml`.
Configuration is passed to Codex for validation, including profile support.

For other inference providers:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="<your-openrouter-api-key>"
npx @openai/codex-security scan . --provider openrouter --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5

export FIREWORKS_API_KEY="<your-fireworks-api-key>"
npx @openai/codex-security scan . --provider fireworks --model accounts/fireworks/models/qwen3-235b-a22b

export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="<your-bedrock-api-key>"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-2"
npx @openai/codex-security scan . --provider amazon-bedrock --model openai.gpt-5.6-luna
```

Bedrock also accepts AWS access keys, profiles, web identity, container
credentials, and the default AWS credential chain. Set `AWS_REGION` and choose
a Bedrock model with `--model`; OpenAI models such as `openai.gpt-5.6-luna`
support `--max-cost`.

Bedrock scans, including Deep Scan workers, default to
`model_reasoning_summary = "none"` because some Bedrock models reject
`reasoning.summary`. This leaves reasoning effort unchanged. Explicit summary
settings in `--codex` overrides or the selected Codex profile take precedence.
For standard scans on older CLI versions, append
`--codex 'model_reasoning_summary="none"'` to your scan command if Bedrock
reports that `reasoning.summary` is unsupported. Deep scans require a CLI
version that forwards this setting to workers.

On Windows, set the API key in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "<your-api-key>"
npx @openai/codex-security scan C:\code\repository
```

Login, logout, scans, validation, patching, and fix verification share a private
credential home for stored OpenAI credentials, including custom providers with
`requires_openai_auth = true`:
`$CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR/codex-home`, or
`$CODEX_HOME/state/plugins/codex-security/codex-home`. Keep this credential
home outside the target directory and every enclosing Git worktree, including
when running a command from a subdirectory. Codex carries
`cli_auth_credentials_store`, `forced_login_method`, and
`forced_chatgpt_workspace_id` from the ambient configuration into this home,
including removing settings that are no longer present in the ambient configuration.
Each command carries its selected provider into this home. Patching and fix
verification also synchronize the ambient home's project-trust decisions and
project-root markers, preserving which project configuration Codex loads.
They hold the credential-home lock until the app-server thread is ready,
then release it before model execution.
Managed-device policies still apply. If this home has no credentials, it imports
an existing file-based Codex sign-in. Logout disables
imports until you log in again.

Finish operations using older versions before upgrading. Runtime preparation
holds the credential-home lock through pauses; exit or crash releases it.
Compatibility heartbeats protect active locks from older heartbeat-only
clients, but those clients can replace a paused client's lock.

Keep `.codex-security-scan.sqlite3` between operations; never remove it during
an operation. PID reuse can make old PID-only locks appear active and block
recovery. Stop all operations using this home before removing an old
`.codex-security-scan.lock` directory manually.

If ChatGPT credentials cannot be refreshed, run `login status`. Retry if the
sign-in recently changed; otherwise run `logout`, then `login`.

Interactive scans ask whether to use ChatGPT or an environment API key when
both are available. The choice applies to that scan. Noninteractive scans,
including CI, JSON output, and dry runs, prefer the API key. Choose with `--auth`:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scan . --auth chatgpt
npx @openai/codex-security scan . --auth api-key
```

`--auth` also works with `validate`, `patch`, and `verify-fix`. These commands
use the same stored login as `scan`, including a sign-in created with
`codex-security login --device-auth`:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security patch OCCURRENCE_ID --auth chatgpt
npx @openai/codex-security verify-fix OCCURRENCE_ID --auth api-key
```

`--auth chatgpt` ignores environment API keys. `--auth api-key` requires
`OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_API_KEY`. The default is `--auth auto`; noninteractive
commands prefer `OPENAI_API_KEY`, then `CODEX_API_KEY`, then stored credentials.
Patch follow-up assessment uses the same selection, and `scan --patch` keeps
the scan's choice. Environment API keys do not replace the saved login.
The SDK uses the same `auth` option on `run`, `validate`, and `preflight`.
Codex may still need ChatGPT credentials to load workspace-managed policies
when using an API key.

## Generate a security policy

`policy` drafts `SECURITY.md` guidance for future scans. It does not run a
vulnerability scan, change application settings, or install the draft in the
checkout. It uses the scan runtime and authentication, requesting read-only
access to the selected repository or component and required tools. Network access,
web search, apps, and MCP servers are disabled. Drafts stay outside the checkout.
The host resolves inherited guidance once and includes each checked descendant
policy separately. Descendant policy links must stay within the selected component.
Inherited and reporting-policy links may also resolve to ancestor `SECURITY.md`
files or the checkout's `.github/SECURITY.md` and `docs/SECURITY.md`.
The model cannot read sibling components or Git metadata. Policy turns deny
access to the resolved Git metadata and markers, including those inside the
selected source tree, nested bare repositories, and associated alternate object
stores.
Policy shell tools inherit only Codex's core environment; custom shell environment
settings, login shells, and shell snapshots are disabled for these turns.
Knowledge-base text stays with the private review artifacts during generation
and is removed afterward.

Known limitation: policy preflight and generation currently fail on Unix
directories with non-UTF-8 names.

On macOS, the pinned Codex runtime does not fully enforce write restrictions
under `/tmp` (including `/private/tmp`). Keep the repository and artifacts outside
that tree when read-only enforcement is required. See the
[upstream sandbox limitation](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/32395).

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security policy .
npx @openai/codex-security policy . --path services/api
npx @openai/codex-security policy . --knowledge-base architecture.md --model gpt-5.6-terra --effort high
npx @openai/codex-security policy . --dry-run --json
```

The repository defaults to the current directory. `--path` selects a component,
which inherits policies from its Git root, with the closest policy taking
precedence. Linked worktrees and initialized submodules use their own roots.
Targets and policy links must stay in the selected checkout, outside Git
metadata; ancestor links cannot widen a component policy's scope.

For an intentional separate Git directory, set `core.worktree` to the checkout's
absolute path. Use `git worktree repair` for moved linked worktrees.

Generation uses three Codex stages: describe the system, build a threat model,
then draft the policy. The first two documents support review; they are not
additional approval steps or policies to install.
In a terminal, it asks about facts the source cannot establish and shows the
exact diff. If both ChatGPT and API-key credentials are available, it asks which
to use; `--auth chatgpt` or `--auth api-key` selects one explicitly.

| Invocation                   | Calls Codex? | Result                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `policy .`                   | Yes          | Ask owner questions, save documents, and preview the draft.             |
| `policy . --headless --json` | Yes          | Save documents without prompts and return their paths and review notes. |
| `policy . --format md`       | Yes          | Generate a draft and write its Markdown to stdout.                      |
| `policy . --dry-run --json`  | No           | Check local inputs and show the resolved target and settings.           |

None of these commands installs `SECURITY.md` in the repository. Output formats
change presentation; they do not turn generation into a saved-draft read.

### Review the draft

Review the saved `SECURITY.md` before copying it to the reported target. Check
links from `.github/SECURITY.md` or `docs/SECURITY.md`: copying can change their
guidance too. Preserve reporting instructions and obtain owner approval for
exclusions, accepted risks, and severity decisions. Later scans read this policy.

Generation and preview check for changes to the selected or inherited policies.
If governing guidance changes during generation, completed documents remain for
inspection, but no completed-draft manifest is written. Other source files are not
frozen; regenerate if relevant source or neighboring policies change.
A failed terminal preview reports a warning and the saved draft paths. Explicit
output formats return the draft directly without running a diff preview.

Use `--headless` or an explicit output format to skip questions. Unanswered
questions remain in the review notes. Drafts default to the Codex Security state
directory; `--output-dir` selects an empty directory outside every enclosing
Git checkout and its Git metadata.

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security policy . --path services/api \
  --headless --output-dir /path/outside/repository/api-policy --json
```

The artifact directory contains:

| File                   | Purpose                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SECURITY.md`          | Editable policy draft.                                    |
| `THREAT_MODEL.md`      | Detailed threat model with source references.             |
| `project-spec.md`      | System description and security boundaries.               |
| `previous-SECURITY.md` | Original policy used for the diff.                        |
| `policy-draft.json`    | Target, policy hashes, revision, model, and review notes. |

Keep supporting documents private until reviewed for disclosure. A generated
threat scenario is neither owner approval nor a confirmed vulnerability.

`--format md` writes the draft to stdout. `--json` returns paths, review notes,
status, and estimated cost. Global filters and token options work with these
formats. Progress goes to stderr. `--full-output` reports failures with
`ok: false`. `--max-cost` applies to the whole generation. If a stage cannot
inspect required source evidence, generation stops and preserves completed
documents. Fix the reported problem and use a new output directory to retry.

### Generate a policy from TypeScript

```ts
import { CodexSecurity } from "@openai/codex-security";

const security = new CodexSecurity();
try {
  const draft = await security.generatePolicy("/path/to/repository", {
    path: "services/api",
    knowledgeBasePaths: ["/path/to/architecture.md"],
    onStage: (stage) => console.error(stage),
  });

  console.log(await security.previewPolicy(draft));
  // Open draft.draftPath in an editor to review the saved policy.
} finally {
  await security.close();
}
```

`preflightPolicy()` checks local inputs without starting Codex.
`previewPolicy()` previews the supplied in-memory draft, uses the client's Python
setting, and makes terminal control characters visible. Editing the saved file
does not change that object. The standalone `securityPolicyDiff()` returns a raw diff
for files or other non-terminal uses; pass an interpreter explicitly if needed.
`generatePolicy()` accepts `auth`, `path`, `knowledgeBasePaths`, `outputDir`,
`maxCostUsd`, `signal`, and progress and cost callbacks. An optional
`answerQuestions` callback receives each group of up to three owner questions
and a cancellation signal. Without it, the questions remain unresolved.

## CLI

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security policy . --path services/api
npx @openai/codex-security scan .
npx @openai/codex-security scan /path/to/repository --path src --path tests
npx @openai/codex-security scan /path/to/repository --diff origin/main --json
npx @openai/codex-security scan /path/to/repository --output-dir /path/outside/repository/results
npx @openai/codex-security scan /path/to/repository --dry-run
```

Use `scan --help` for options, `--version` for the installed version, and
`info --json` for package, plugin, runtime, and model details. `--dry-run`
runs local preflight checks. `info -c FILE --json` inspects resolved configuration
and its sources without a repository or runtime.

### Project files

Use `scan -c FILE` / `scan --config FILE` to load reusable scan settings:

```bash
codex-security scan . -c codex-security.yaml --dry-run --json
codex-security scan . -c codex-security.json --model gpt-5.6-terra
codex-security init
codex-security info -c codex-security.yaml --json
```

Select one `.yaml`, `.yml`, or `.json` file. `scan`, `bulk-scan`, `scan-components`,
and `info` accept `-c`. They also accept an operator-set
`CODEX_SECURITY_PROJECT_CONFIG`; an explicit `-c` wins. Without either, no file is
loaded or discovered. The repository still comes from the command's target
selection. SDK `run()` and saved reruns do not load project files automatically.

The selected file is trusted like CLI options and SDK `codexOverrides`. Native
settings can start configured MCP server processes and select model-service destinations. Do not
select configuration controlled by an untrusted repository or pull request; keep
CI scanner configuration outside the checkout being assessed.

`init [file]` writes `codex-security.yaml` by default and never overwrites an
existing file. YAML starters show defaults as comments; JSON starters contain the
editor schema hint, relative to the chosen file and the invocation directory's
local package installation. `info` reports effective model details and native key sources
without dumping raw native values.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=./node_modules/@openai/codex-security/schemas/project-config.schema.json
scan:
  mode: standard
  scope:
    paths: [src]
codex:
  model: gpt-6-sol
  model_reasoning_effort: xhigh
policy:
  fail_on_severity: high
```

All settings are optional; `{}` uses the existing defaults. JSON files can use a
root `$schema` string pointing to the same packaged schema. Schema hints are for
editors; the CLI uses its bundled validator without fetching URLs, coercing values,
or dropping unknown keys. Native `codex` settings retain their existing checks and
profile semantics. CLI `scan --schema --json` describes command arguments.

Settings use built-in defaults, applicable legacy deep defaults, the file, then
explicit CLI values. Lists and scope variants are replaced. `--head` can refine
a file diff and `--base` a file working-tree scope. A selected native profile can
still override root model/effort values. Existing native alias-conflict checks
and the behavior of `--provider openai` are unchanged.

File context, instruction, validation, and output paths resolve from the file's
directory. CLI file paths resolve from the invocation directory; scope paths
resolve from the repository. The file cannot select a different repository or
enable automatic patching/publication. The loader does not evaluate code,
interpolate environment values, include remote files, or merge multiple files.

Dry-run output adds `projectConfig.path` and `projectConfig.sources`, selected
prompt paths, and the finding policy without dumping raw native configuration.
Missing or invalid selected files exit `2`. Help, version, and command schema
output do not load project files. Existing scan and finding-policy exit codes
remain unchanged.

### Scan options and output

`--path` scopes a scan to one or more paths, `--diff` scans committed changes,
and `--working-tree` scans staged and unstaged changes. Deep scans support
repository and path targets.

Bulk scans use clean, shallow checkouts and support repository or path scopes.
They reject configured diff or working-tree scopes before starting unless each
affected CSV row supplies its own path scope.

Working-tree snapshots include files from untracked nested Git repositories.
Initialized submodules must be clean and checked out at the commit recorded by
the parent repository.

Repeat `--knowledge-base PATH` for UTF-8 text files with any extension (including
JSON and SARIF), PDF, or Word (`.docx`) files. Directories are searched recursively,
skipping other binary files. Explicitly supplied unsupported binary files are rejected.
Bulk scans share these documents with every repository.

Use an empty output directory outside the scanned directory and enclosing Git
worktree. On macOS/Linux, existing directories must be private to you
(`chmod 700`). `--archive-existing` moves previous results to
`<output-dir>.previous-<timestamp>-<id>`; add `--dry-run` to preview the move.
SARIF output, when produced, is at `<scan-dir>/exports/results.sarif`.

Scans are report-only by default. Set `--fail-on-severity high` to exit with
`1` if a completed scan finds high or critical issues. Incomplete scans exit
with `2`, writing available results to stdout and a coverage warning to stderr.

For machine-readable scan output (`--format json` or `--format jsonl`), a scan
execution failure writes one structured object to stdout:

```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "code": "SCAN_FAILED",
  "message": "..."
}
```

With `--full-output`, the same code and message are reported under `error` in
an `ok: false` envelope instead.

The command still exits with `2` for runtime, export, invalid-input, or
incomplete-scan failures, and human-readable diagnostics remain on stderr.
Use `scan --schema --format json` to discover this failure variant alongside
the successful scan output. Cancellation and termination retain their `130`
and `143` exit codes.

### Import findings as a saved scan

Import an existing findings CSV or JSON file into local scan history and SQLite:

```bash
codex-security scan import --csv /path/to/findings.csv
codex-security scan import --json /path/to/findings.json --format json
codex-security scan import --csv /path/to/findings.csv --dry-run
```

Supply exactly one of `--csv PATH` or `--json PATH`. CSV uses the existing
[findings CSV template](https://github.com/openai/codex-security/blob/main/examples/findings.csv),
including the optional `candidate_id` column. JSON accepts a complete
`codex-security.findings` document or `{ "findings": [...] }`, with each finding
matching the existing findings schema. On `scan import`, `--json` selects the
input file; use `--format json` for JSON output. Other commands retain their
existing `--json` output flag. The selected input must be a regular file, and its
path must not traverse symbolic links or directory junctions. Use the direct
filesystem path when the file or a parent directory is linked.

Each import creates one completed scan using the configured
`CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR`. The target is a retained copy of the input dataset,
independent of the current repository. Every source occurrence remains a separate
finding, including duplicate reports. Original identifiers are preserved in
`extensions.import`; the original file is sealed under `artifacts/import/`.
JSON writeup paths are retained as source metadata without reading external files.

Completion means the import finished. Coverage is unknown and the report states
that no security analysis was performed. Importing requires no model calls or
authentication. `--dry-run` validates without saving a scan. `--output-dir` and
`--archive-existing` control saved output, and `scans rerun SCAN_ID` reimports the
retained input.

### Generate mock scan results

Use `--mock` to populate a Standard scan with synthetic test data in seconds,
without Codex authentication or any LLM calls:

```bash
codex-security scan /path/to/repository --mock
codex-security scan /path/to/repository --mock --output-dir /path/outside/repository/mock-results
```

The SDK equivalent is `await security.run(repository, { mock: true })`.
Mock mode is off by default. It uses normal target validation, scan registration,
artifact finalization, reports, and local scan/finding history. Output directories,
archiving, JSON output, exports, and `--fail-on-severity` work as usual.
`--dry-run` only validates inputs; `--mock` saves a completed scan.

Each run contains 12 findings across all severity levels: eight stable findings
recur on subsequent scans of the same repository, and four have new identities
on every run. Two pairs describe the same root causes with different titles and
identities, providing inputs for deduplication testing. Mock scans skip automatic
LLM matching; existing identity-based history indexing still runs. Separate
comparison or deduplication commands retain their usual model behavior.

Titles, provenance, artifact metadata, and reports identify the results as
synthetic. Paths and code snippets are fictional and are never written into the
repository. Completion means fixture generation finished, not that the repository
was audited. Results enter the selected local state just like other scans; set
`CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR` to a separate directory when creating disposable data.
Token usage is zero. `scans rerun` preserves mock mode.

Mock mode supports repository, path, and diff targets in Standard mode. It cannot
be combined with `--dry-run`, `--patch`, Deep mode, custom validation, or post-scan
prompts. Scan prompts and knowledge-base inputs do not change the fixtures, and
mock scans do not offer interactive patching.

### Attribute scans to end users

When scanning on behalf of users, pass each user's stable hashed ID:

```ts
await security.run("/path/to/repository", {
  auth: "api-key",
  safetyIdentifier: hashedUserId,
});
```

```bash
codex-security scan /path/to/repository --auth api-key --safety-identifier hashed-user-id
```

Use a nonblank ID of 1 to 64 characters without NUL or personal data such as
email addresses. It applies to the scan, workers, retries, and follow-up work
without changing shared configuration. Supply it again for reruns.

The runtime needs native `--safety-identifier` support, and the plugin must
forward it to workers. The bundled runtime doesn't support it yet; choose a
compatible build with `CODEX_CLI_PATH`. The SDK checks the ID's format, not
runtime or plugin compatibility. Older versions may omit the ID.

### Scan project components

`scan --path` runs one scan across selected paths. To scan each local project
component separately (standard mode by default), use `scan-components`:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scan-components /path/to/project \
  --component apps/api --component apps/web --component packages/shared \
  --workers 4 --output-dir /path/outside/project/results
```

Use `-c FILE` to share settings, including `scan.mode: deep`, context and prompt
files, per-scan deep workers, cost limits, and severity policy. Component plans
override the file's scope. `output.directory` supplies the results directory when
`--output-dir` is omitted. A configured severity threshold returns exit `1` after
completed scans; failures or incomplete results return `2`.

Use `--auto` instead of `--component` for a proposed split. Save a plan to
review or edit, then run it with a new output directory:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scan-components /path/to/project \
  --auto --plan-only --output-dir /path/outside/project/plan
npx @openai/codex-security scan-components /path/to/project \
  --components-file /path/outside/project/plan/components.json \
  --output-dir /path/outside/project/results
```

For large repositories, automatic planning splits inventories into separate calls
that fit Codex's input character limit. It preserves directory boundaries where
possible and subdivides oversized packages and flat directories as needed. Each
call uses a fresh context and can select only paths within its batch. Omitted
files are retained in `Other files` components within those same boundaries.
Large repositories can therefore require more planning calls and produce more
components. Review or edit the saved plan before scanning with `--components-file`.

Components use repository-relative paths:

```json
{
  "components": [
    { "name": "API", "paths": ["apps/api", "packages/auth"] },
    { "name": "Web", "paths": ["apps/web"] }
  ]
}
```

Automatic planning respects Git ignore rules and groups omitted files under
`Other files`. Each proposed path must contain an inventoried file. Planning
leaves source files unchanged.

Each component saves artifacts under `component-N/`. Combined `findings.json`
merges high-confidence root-cause matches, keeping the highest severity and
original IDs. Uncertain matches stay separate. `summary.json` records coverage
and matching status; `report.md` links to component reports. Export and publish
from the individual scan folders, not the combined summary.

Large comparisons use bounded batches that cover every earlier/later finding
pair. Overlapping confirmed groups are joined in code. Finding text is not
truncated; pairs above Codex's input limit leave matching incomplete.

Use an empty output directory outside the project. Failed components don't
stop others, but failures, incomplete coverage, or failed matching exit with
`2`. Retry failed or incomplete components with
`--components-file retry-components.json` and a new output directory.
The retry report covers only those components; it does not update the original
combined report.

`--max-cost` applies per component, excluding planning and matching.
`--model` and `--effort` also apply to matching; `--auth` applies throughout.
Planning and matching reject an ambient command provider that conflicts with
explicit `--auth chatgpt` or `--auth api-key`. A command provider explicitly
selected through SDK `codexOverrides` retains its authentication configuration.
Use `--knowledge-base`, `--scan-prompt-file`, and `--post-scan-prompt-file` as for
bulk scans.

From TypeScript, use `runComponentScans({ repository, outputDir, components })`.
Use `auto: true` for planning, `planOnly: true` to save the plan without scans,
and `scanOptions.auth` to select credentials.

### Configure deep scans

For `scan --mode deep`, `--workers` sets discovery concurrency and `--subagents`
sets subagents per worker. `--stop-after-no-new` stops after that many runs
without new issues. `--max-discovery-runs` and `--max-time-hours` cap discovery
runs and duration. SDK equivalents:

```ts
await security.run("/path/to/repository", {
  mode: "deep",
  workers: 2,
  subagents: 0,
  stopAfterNoNew: 3,
  stopAfterConsecutiveErrors: 2,
  maxDiscoveryRuns: 10,
  maxTimeHours: 1.5,
});
```

Set defaults in `$CODEX_HOME/codex-security/config.toml`:

```toml
[deep_scan]
workers = 4
subagents = 3
stop_after_no_new = 4
stop_after_consecutive_errors = 3
max_discovery_runs = 40
max_time_hours = 96
```

CLI and SDK options override these defaults. Project files can use
`scan.deep.stop_after_consecutive_errors`, and SDK calls can use
`stopAfterConsecutiveErrors`; there is no new CLI flag for it. `--codex` cannot
configure this section. Worker and run counts must
be positive integers; `subagents` can be zero. Legacy `workers = "auto"` means
four workers. Unknown keys are rejected.

`max_time_hours` accepts positive values up to 96, including fractional hours.
At the deadline, discovery stops; the scan combines and returns completed findings.

`scan --workers` controls discovery workers within one deep scan;
`bulk-scan --workers` controls how many repositories are scanned concurrently.

The project-file deep block uses `subagents_per_worker` for the existing SDK/CLI
`subagents` setting. A valid deep block can remain inactive in standard mode;
explicit deep CLI options require deep mode. All six active values are resolved
before runtime preparation and saved in new recipes. Complete saved values are
independent of later changes to the legacy TOML file.

### Runtime configuration and worker limits

Scans use these isolated Codex defaults instead of your user or repository
configuration:

```toml
approval_policy = "on-request"
approvals_reviewer = "auto_review"
cli_auth_credentials_store = "auto"
model = "gpt-6-sol"
model_reasoning_effort = "xhigh"
model_reasoning_summary = "detailed" # "none" for amazon-bedrock
show_raw_agent_reasoning = true

[features]
plugins = true
goals = true

[features.multi_agent_v2]
enabled = true
max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 9

[windows]
sandbox = "unelevated"
```

Use `--model` to choose a model and `--effort minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max`
for reasoning effort. Repeat `--codex KEY=VALUE` for other TOML settings:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scan . \
  --model gpt-5.6-terra \
  --effort high \
  --codex features.multi_agent_v2.max_concurrent_threads_per_session=4
```

The thread limit of `9` includes the parent and up to eight delegated workers.
It is separate from deep-scan and bulk-scan worker counts.

Quote string values as TOML, for example
`--codex 'model_reasoning_effort="high"'`. Do not pass both `--model` and
`--codex 'model="..."'`, or both `--effort` and
`--codex 'model_reasoning_effort="..."'`: conflicting or repeated keys are
rejected.

Choose plugins with `--plugin-path`. Overrides of `plugins`, `marketplaces`,
or `features.plugins` are rejected, including in profiles. Multi-agent v2 must
stay enabled: `agents.max_threads` and
`features.multi_agent_v2.enabled=false` are rejected.

`validate`, `patch`, and `verify-fix` accept `--auth`, `--effort`, and the `model`,
`model_reasoning_effort`, and `analytics.enabled` keys in `--codex`, but no
other runtime overrides.

Use `--codex 'analytics.enabled=false'` to disable Codex usage analytics and
built-in metrics for a command:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security validate "Candidate finding" --codex 'analytics.enabled=false'
npx @openai/codex-security patch "Security issue" --codex 'analytics.enabled=false'
npx @openai/codex-security verify-fix "Security issue" --codex 'analytics.enabled=false'
```

The same setting works for `scan` and `bulk-scan`. An explicit setting is
preserved when `scan --patch` starts remediation and when
`patch --assess-patch-risk` starts its follow-up assessment. Boolean `true`
is also accepted; omitting the setting preserves the command's existing
configuration and Codex defaults. Validation ignores user configuration.
For stored OpenAI credentials, patching and verification read configuration
from the shared credential home. API-key commands and custom providers that use their own credentials retain
their ambient Codex configuration. Patching and verification preserve project trust from the
ambient home; explicit `--codex` settings apply to the command and its
patch-risk assessment.

This setting does not control explicitly configured OpenTelemetry log or trace
exporters, authentication, integrations, or CLI update checks.

See [Local security model](#local-security-model) for approval and filesystem
restrictions.

Custom Codex executables need thread source attribution for `exec` and
`app-server` (Codex 0.149.1+). On Windows, use a native `.exe` or `.com`;
command shims such as `codex.cmd` fall back to the bundled executable.

Python lookup order: `--python` (on `scan`, `bulk-scan`, or `export`) or SDK
`pythonPath`, then `PYTHON`, the managed Codex runtime, and `python3` or `python`
on `PATH` (`py` also works on Windows). `CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR` overrides
`CODEX_HOME` for state storage. Keep state and results outside the repository.

### Progress and cost

Interactive scans show full-screen progress; CI, redirected output, and
`--headless` use plain status lines. Results go to stdout, progress and
diagnostics to stderr. Add `--verbose` for diagnostics. Check logs for
sensitive information before sharing them.

The token summary shows uncached input, cache reads, cache writes, output,
and total tokens. Total tokens include all input plus output; cache reads and
writes are subsets of input, not extra tokens. When cache-write usage is missing,
the summary shows uncached input and cache writes as unavailable.
The final summary preserves missing-data information from a matching session log.
If the Codex runtime converts an omitted count to zero before recording it, the
CLI cannot distinguish that zero from reported usage.

Cost displays show a range using
[standard API prices](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing), because
runtime usage does not identify which requests received long-context pricing.
The minimum assumes short-context pricing; the maximum assumes long-context
pricing. These are token-cost estimates for the observed usage, excluding other
processing tiers, fees, surcharges, and account-specific pricing.

JSON results, scan history, and bulk-scan receipts preserve
`cost.estimatedUsdRange`: `min`, `max`, and `context: "unknown"`. A `null` maximum
means an upper estimate is unavailable, including models without verified
long-context rates. `cost.pricing` records the price source, verification date,
processing tier, short-context rates, and verified long-context rates when known.
Models without known short-context prices still have no cost estimate.

For compatibility, `cacheWriteInputTokens` remains the reported token subtotal.
`cacheWriteInputTokensReported: false` means at least one included usage record
did not report cache writes. Raw usage uses `cache_write_input_tokens_reported`.
In that case, the range minimum prices unclassified input as ordinary input,
and the maximum allows it to be cache writes. Token counts remain unchanged.
Older saved records remain readable and display a labeled legacy estimate;
they are not repriced using current rates.

For compatibility, `cost.estimatedUsd` retains the short-context baseline used
by existing spending limits. `cost.pricing.context: "short"` describes that
baseline, not observed request contexts. Use `estimatedUsdRange` for cost
reporting. This change does not change when spending limits stop scans.

`--max-cost USD` stops the scan and its workers when estimated cost exceeds
the limit, though in-flight requests can finish above it. If deep-scan
discovery has finished, the scan returns a sealed partial report without more
model calls and lists unvalidated candidates as follow-up work. Bulk scans
apply the limit per repository attempt.

With `--max-cost`, automatic finding-history matching makes at most one extra
model call. If it needs more context, the completed scan is kept and a warning
directs you to run `scans match --all` explicitly.

For a single scan in the interactive dashboard, reaching 80% of the limit
offers a higher **total** USD limit. Enter a larger amount to approve it, or
press Enter with an empty input or Escape to keep the current limit. The scan
continues running while you decide, and the existing limit remains enforced
until the increase is saved. Increases keep the same scan and accumulated cost;
they do not restart work or extend time or discovery limits. CI, JSON/JSONL,
`--headless`, and `--verbose` scans do not offer budget increases. If usage crosses the limit
before an increase is approved, the scan still stops.

SDK callers can supply `onBudgetApproaching({ maxCostUsd, cost, signal })` and
return a higher total limit, or `undefined` to keep the current limit. The
callback runs once per limit at 80% usage without blocking tracking or
execution. Its signal aborts when the scan stops or finishes model work; late
answers are ignored. Invalid increases or failures to save them leave the
existing limit in place and report a warning. `onCost(cost, maxCostUsd)` reports
the current limit, including after an approved increase.

These amounts estimate API-equivalent model usage, not ChatGPT subscription
allowance. Post-scan prompts run after scan cost tracking ends and are outside
this limit.

### Bulk scans

Run `gh auth login`, then `npx @openai/codex-security bulk-scan` to select
GitHub repositories pushed in the last 90 days. Forks and archived repositories
are excluded; private checkouts use your GitHub CLI sign-in. The command asks
for an output directory and saves your selection there as `repositories.csv`.
`--output-dir` requires CSV input.

For CI or an existing repository list, pass a CSV with `id`, `repository`, and
`revision` (full commit hash). Optional `scope`, `mode`, and `prompt` columns
customize each scan:

```csv
id,repository,revision,scope,mode,prompt
service,https://github.com/acme/service.git,0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567,src,standard,Focus on authentication and authorization.
```

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security bulk-scan repositories.csv \
  --output-dir /path/outside/repositories/security-scans --workers 4
```

`--scan-prompt-file PATH` adds instructions to a scan or all bulk scans. Each
repository's CSV `prompt` follows the shared instructions.
`-c FILE` shares config with single scans: CSV mode/scope override file defaults,
and deep settings apply only to deep rows. `output.directory` can supply the
results directory. `fail_on_severity` returns exit `1` without retrying completed
scans, including when resuming saved results. A changed project configuration
requires a new campaign output directory.
`--post-scan-prompt-file PATH` runs a follow-up in the same authenticated session,
even after a failed or incomplete scan, but not after cancellation or a
cost-limit stop.

`--workers` defaults to `4`. `--max-attempts` defaults to `1` attempt per pending
repository per invocation. Rerunning the command continues the campaign, skips
completed results, and starts new attempts for pending repositories. If an
attempt directory is occupied, that repository stops before replacing its
checkout and the command recommends `--recover`.

#### Recovering failed or interrupted bulk scans

Use the original CSV, output directory, and campaign options with `--recover`:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security bulk-scan repositories.csv \
  --output-dir /path/outside/repositories/security-scans --recover
```

Recovery requires an existing campaign with a matching manifest. It skips
completed results, including partial coverage, and repositories never started.
For each failed or interrupted repository, it checks the latest attempt:

- A sealed scan is recorded in `results.jsonl` without scanning again.
- An eligible running Deep Scan resumes its original session, keeping its scan
  ID, completed workers, artifacts, saved settings, and accumulated cost.
- A failed, canceled, or otherwise unavailable scan starts a new attempt at the
  CSV's pinned revision. Attempt numbers account for both receipts and existing
  directories. Old artifacts and checkouts are preserved; new attempts use
  `recovery-checkouts/<id>/attempt-<n>`.

`--workers` still defaults to `4`; `--max-attempts` defaults to one recovery or
new attempt per repository. A resume connection failure stops that repository
for this invocation instead of starting another scan. Other repositories
continue. Failed and interrupted recovery checkouts remain available for a later
`--recover`; fresh completed checkouts are removed after recording the result.
If a reboot interrupted a receipt write, its unfinished tail is saved beside
`results.jsonl` as `results.jsonl.interrupted-<id>` before appending valid records.

Same-scan resume requires the original checkout, session logs, and Codex Security
state directory. Recovery does not reconstruct deleted checkpoints or fix the
underlying cause of execution failures. New attempts incur new scan costs.
Any remaining failures or partial coverage keep exit code `2`.
`bulk-scan --help` lists all options.

### Custom validation

Replace the final validation step of a standard or diff scan with a prompt
file. Source review still runs; discovery workers do not receive this prompt.

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scan . --validation-prompt-file validation.md
```

The SDK accepts the same file as `validationPromptFile`, or inline text as
`validationPrompt`:

```ts
const result = await security.run(repository, {
  validationPrompt:
    "Run scripts/validate.sh, test each candidate through the local API, and stop the test environment when finished.",
});
```

Put setup, allowed targets, required evidence, and cleanup in the prompt.
There are no separate setup or teardown hooks. Use environment variables for
credentials; keep secrets out of prompts and validation output. Deep scans
reject this option; scans without candidates skip it.

The SDK supplies the candidate IDs and requires a `CustomValidationResult`:

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "reason": null,
  "validations": [
    {
      "candidateId": "candidate-1",
      "validation": {
        "disposition": "reportable",
        "method": "integration test",
        "confidence": "high",
        "confidence_rationale": "The test reproduced the reported behavior.",
        "rubric": "Check the protected operation.",
        "evidence": ["The unauthorized request succeeded."],
        "counterevidence_or_proof_gap": "",
        "remaining_uncertainty": "",
        "artifact_paths": []
      },
      "severity": null,
      "impact": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Return one result per candidate with disposition `reportable`, `suppressed`,
`not_applicable`, or `deferred`. Set `severity` or `impact` to
`{ "level": "medium", "rationale": "..." }` to revise an assessment, or `null`
to retain it. Identity and source locations stay unchanged.

The scan saves candidates and results, including suppressed and deferred
cases, under `artifacts/custom-validation/`. Coverage is incomplete if setup
fails, output is incomplete or invalid, or any candidate is deferred. An
incompatible plugin stops the scan; validation never falls back to the default.
Repeat `--validation-prompt-file` on reruns.

### Publish findings to Cloud

Choose completed scans from local history:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security publish scan --to cloud --dry-run --json
```

Press Space to select scans, then Enter to submit. Nothing is preselected.

For scripts, repeat `--scan` with saved IDs or unique prefixes of at least
eight characters:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security publish scan \
  --scan SCAN_ID_A --scan SCAN_ID_B \
  --to cloud --dry-run --json
```

Find IDs with `scans list --json`, or use `--scan latest` for the current
repository's latest completed scan. You still need the local sealed artifacts.

`--dry-run` checks inputs and prints findings without logging in or uploading.
Uploads need ChatGPT credentials saved to a file. Set this in Codex
`config.toml`, then sign in with ChatGPT again:

```toml
cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"
```

Cloud publication rejects automatic and keyring storage, even if an
`auth.json` file exists: the file may be stale or belong to another account.

For CSV input, use an export from `codex-security export --export-format csv`:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security publish scan --to cloud \
  --csv /path/outside/repository/findings.csv
```

The [findings CSV template](https://github.com/openai/codex-security/blob/main/examples/findings.csv)
has the required columns; deep-scan exports may add `candidate_id`. `--csv`
only supports Cloud and cannot be combined with scan IDs or directories.

For artifacts outside local history, pass a directory or repeat `--scan-dir PATH`.
Each directory must contain one completed, sealed scan. Bulk-run directories
and `results.jsonl` files aren't accepted. Don't mix directories with `--scan`.

Multiple scans return:

- `results`: receipts or dry-run previews, each with its `scanId` and `scanDir`.
- `failed`: errors with `scanDir` and, for saved selections, `scanId`.
- `notAttempted`: saved scan IDs, or paths for directory inputs, that the command
  did not reach before cancellation.

One scan returns its result directly. Uploads run sequentially. A failed upload
doesn't stop the rest, but the command exits with `2` if any failed. Cancellation
stops new requests and returns results so far with `130` (Ctrl-C) or `143`
(SIGTERM), unless all publications were already confirmed.

Save the output: Cloud receipts aren't stored in scan history. They contain
Cloud finding IDs in request order, not local IDs. Uploads aren't retried
automatically. Cloud may have accepted an upload even if its receipt is missing
or invalid. Check Cloud before retrying; never resend a scan with a confirmed
receipt.

### Publish completed scans to Linear

Linear publication accepts one completed scan:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security publish scan --scan SCAN_ID \
  --to linear \
  --linear-team TEAM_ID
```

Choose a scan by ID, unique prefix, `latest`, or directory (positional or
`--scan-dir PATH`). Omit the selector for an interactive picker. Live publication
and `--skip-existing` require the scan in local history; a directory-based
`--dry-run` alone does not.

Add `--linear-project PROJECT_ID` (`--project` is an alias) to place issues in
a project. Destination flags override `CODEX_SECURITY_LINEAR_TEAM` and
`CODEX_SECURITY_LINEAR_PROJECT`. `--dry-run` previews issue titles without
contacting Linear; `--json` returns structured results.

Sign in to Codex and connect Linear to publish with your existing Codex
configuration; publication doesn't use the isolated scan home. To use the
Linear API directly, set a personal API key:

```bash
export CODEX_SECURITY_LINEAR_API_KEY=YOUR_LINEAR_PERSONAL_API_KEY
npx @openai/codex-security publish scan /path/to/completed-scan \
  --to linear \
  --linear-team TEAM_ID
```

Direct API publication leaves issues unassigned unless `--linear-assignee`
specifies a user ID or email. `--linear-api-key KEY` overrides the environment
variable, but exposes the key in shell history and process listings. Keys are
omitted from saved results and artifacts; error messages are returned unchanged.

Check scan integrity and recorded publications before publishing:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security publish check /path/to/completed-scan \
  --to linear --linear-team TEAM_ID --json
```

`publish check` is read-only. With an API key it also checks authentication,
team, project, and assignee access; connected-app access is `not-checked`.
Issue-creation permission is always `not-tested`.

Each finding becomes an issue titled `[Codex Security][HIGH] Finding title`
with source locations, code, evidence, and remediation. Choose a destination
authorized to receive these details. Local history stores successful issue IDs
separately from sealed scan artifacts.

Republishing creates duplicates by default. `--skip-existing` skips recorded
successes for the same occurrence, team, and project, without checking remote
issues. Results distinguish `created` and `skipped` issues. Add `--dry-run`
to preview the remaining findings.

After an interrupted or indeterminate publication, check the retained handoff,
evidence, and Linear destination before retrying. Issues may exist without a
local record. The CLI can't recover those issues, and `--skip-existing` can't
prevent duplicates from them or concurrent publications.

```ts
import { publishScan } from "@openai/codex-security";

const publication = await publishScan("/path/to/completed-scan", {
  destination: "linear",
  teamId: "TEAM_ID",
});

console.log(publication.scanId);
console.log(publication.created.length);
```

Options include `projectId`, `skipExisting`, `linearApiKey` for direct API
publication, and `assigneeId` (user ID or email). `checkScanPublication` accepts
the same destination options for a read-only check.

### Classify finding severity

Classify findings after a scan or dedupe without repeating discovery or changing
the original severity, evidence, or sealed scan artifacts:

```bash
codex-security classify-severity --scan SCAN_ID --rubric /path/to/policy.md --json
codex-security classify-severity --scan latest --rubric /path/to/policy.md --json
codex-security classify-severity --scan-dir /path/to/completed-scan --json
```

`--scan` accepts a saved scan ID, unique prefix, or `latest` for the current
repository, matching `dedupe` and `publish scan`. `--scan-dir` accepts an external
completed scan without requiring local history. Supply exactly one selector.
Omitting `--rubric` inherits each finding's existing severity without a model call.

`--rubric PATH` supplies the classification policy. Repeat `--knowledge-base PATH`
to provide supporting architecture, deployment, or business context. Both accept
the same UTF-8 text, PDF, DOCX, and directory inputs as scan knowledge bases.
Rubric classification uses the full supplied report and context in a separate
read-only Codex turn per finding, without source inspection, tools, or new
validation. `--model` and `--effort` select the classification model and reasoning
effort; otherwise Codex's configured model and the helper's medium effort apply.

The result contains one assessment per selected finding:

- `decision`: `assessed` or `excluded`; policy exclusions do not become Low.
- `level`: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, or `informational`; null for exclusions.
- `rubricLabel`: the policy's original label, such as `URGENT`, normalized to
  `critical`; null for inherited severity or exclusions.
- `rationale`, separate `confidence`, and `reviewTrigger` describing a missing
  fact that would change the classification. Inherited severity has no new
  classification-confidence judgment.
- `findingId`, `occurrenceId`, and `inputSha256` binding the assessment to the
  report. Top-level metadata includes `assessedAt`, `rubricSha256`, and
  `knowledgeBaseSha256` for the supplied policy and context snapshots.

Scan classification saves each successful finding immediately in the local
workbench SQLite database. Rerunning skips assessments with matching finding
evidence, rubric, and knowledge-base hashes, including exclusions, and returns
both reused and newly generated assessments. Changed inputs are classified again.
Use `--reprocess` to rerun every selected finding regardless of its saved
assessment; each row is replaced only after its new assessment succeeds. A failed
or canceled run keeps completed checkpoints, so a normal retry resumes missing
work. Changing only the model or effort requires `--reprocess`.

SQLite is authoritative. A successful run also exports the complete selected
result to `severity-classification.json` alongside the sealed artifacts. The file
is replaced atomically and is not read for reuse or publication. The scan's
original findings and severity are unchanged. The database stores the requested
selection and policy/context hashes; publication rejects an incomplete selection
or assessments whose inputs no longer match. Rubric documents are read at
classification time, not again at publication time.

```bash
codex-security classify-severity --scan latest --rubric /path/to/policy.md --reprocess
```

Use repeatable `--finding-id ID` to classify a selected set, such as the
`uniqueFindingIds` returned by dedupe. With a saved classification, Linear
publication defaults to that selection, omits excluded records, and uses assessed
severity for issue priority and title. The description retains original scan
severity and adds classification reasoning. Without a saved classification,
publication retains its existing severity mapping and selection behavior.
Publication rejects assessments whose IDs or evidence hashes no longer match.

```bash
codex-security classify-severity --scan SCAN_ID --rubric /path/to/policy.md \
  --finding-id FINDING_ID --json
codex-security publish scan --scan SCAN_ID --to linear --linear-team TEAM_ID \
  --dry-run --json
codex-security publish scan --scan SCAN_ID --to linear --linear-team TEAM_ID \
  --skip-existing --json
```

`publish scan --to linear` also accepts repeatable `--finding-id ID` to select a
subset directly. If a classification exists, every explicitly selected finding
must have an assessment. Classification does not change existing Linear tickets;
`--skip-existing` preserves recorded tickets and any human priority edits. It
retains the existing limitations around unrecorded or concurrent publications.

The SDK exposes the same operations:

```ts
import {
  classifySeverity,
  classifyScanSeverity,
  classifyScanDirectorySeverity,
  publishScan,
} from "@openai/codex-security";

// Supplied reports from any source: returns an assessment without writing files.
const classification = await classifySeverity(findings, {
  rubricPath: "/path/to/policy.md",
  knowledgeBasePaths: ["/path/to/context.md"],
});

// Saved IDs (including prefixes/latest), or sealed directories; saves an assessment.
await classifyScanSeverity("SCAN_ID", { rubricPath: "/path/to/policy.md" });
await classifyScanDirectorySeverity(scanDirectory, {
  rubricPath: "/path/to/policy.md",
  findingIds: dedupeResult.uniqueFindingIds,
});

await publishScan(scanDirectory, {
  destination: "linear",
  teamId: "TEAM_ID",
  skipExisting: true,
});

// Alternatively supply a classification directly, without a saved assessment.
await publishScan(scanDirectory, {
  destination: "linear",
  teamId: "TEAM_ID",
  classification,
  findingIds: classification.assessments.map(({ findingId }) => findingId),
  dryRun: true,
});
```

`classifySeverity` accepts reports with `findingId`, `title`, and `summary`, plus
their available evidence and metadata. Original `severity` and `occurrenceId`
may be absent for imported reports; reports without severity require a rubric.
`classifySeverity` remains an in-memory operation without database persistence.
The scan wrappers use the local state database (also for external scan
directories), accept `reprocess: true`, and accept `findingIds: []` as an
intentionally empty selection. Rows outside the selected set are retained.
Use the same `CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR` for classification and publication.
JSON exports from versions without database checkpoints must be reclassified
once before they can be reused.
Pass `signal` to cancel any classification operation. Keep human overrides in the
calling workflow or issue tracker; assessments remain separate recommendations.

### Suggest finding owners

Suggest contributors who can fix findings in a local Git repository:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security suggest-owners findings.json --source-root /path/to/repo --json > owners.json
```

The input is a Codex Security findings document or a JSON object containing a
`findings` array, such as the output of `export --export-format json`. The source
root defaults to the current directory. The command reads committed `HEAD`,
source around each finding location, blame for the affected lines, and file
history reachable from that commit. It does not read uncommitted source or change
findings, files, or ticket assignments.

The checkout must own its Git references and objects. Linked worktrees and bound
separate Git directories are supported. Checkouts that borrow external object
stores, including `git clone --shared`, are rejected; use an independent clone.

Each result preserves the finding and occurrence IDs and has status `identified`,
`abstained`, or `error`. Identified results include an observed Git author name
and email, a reason, and checked Git citations. Missing source or unclear
ownership produces an abstention. Git identities do not establish active
employment or an issue tracker account. Match accounts before assigning tickets.
Use a checkout that matches the findings; otherwise their line ranges may be stale.

The command uses existing Codex credentials and the Codex Security default model and effort.
Use `--model` and `--effort` to override them. Model selection runs with tools and
network access disabled. Exit code `0` includes successful recommendations and
abstentions; `2` means invalid input or at least one failed recommendation. A
per-finding failure retains the other results in the report. Cancellation uses
exit code `130` for SIGINT or `143` for SIGTERM.

The SDK accepts finding IDs, titles, summaries, and source locations directly:

```ts
import { suggestOwners } from "@openai/codex-security";

const owners = await suggestOwners("/path/to/repo", result.findings, {
  reasoningEffort: "high",
});
```

SDK inputs may include `sourceRevision`. If it differs from `HEAD`, the collector
ignores the old line ranges and reports the mismatch. Reports record the analyzed
revision, model, effort, and limitations; they remain separate from scan artifacts.

### Feedback

Send a problem report to OpenAI and share the returned feedback ID with support:

```sh
codex-security feedback --reason "The scan stopped before it finished"
codex-security feedback SCAN_ID --reason "The scan stopped before it finished" --include-logs
```

Without an ID, `feedback` selects the most recently started scan in the current
repository, including active or failed scans. If there are no saved scans, it sends
a general report. The report includes your description, version details, and the selected
scan and session IDs. Add `--json` for structured output.

Logs are off by default. `--include-logs` uploads Codex diagnostics and saved scan
and worker activity. These can contain source code, prompts, findings, tool
output, and other sensitive data. Only include logs you can share with OpenAI.
The command uses Codex's feedback service and respects `feedback.enabled = false`.

For scans started through the Desktop plugin, run the command on the machine
where the scan ran, using the same Codex home and Codex Security state directory.
It searches active and archived sessions in both that Codex home and the CLI's
managed home, and attaches available worker logs even if the parent log is missing.
Earlier retries that started separate sessions may be missing when their session
IDs are no longer recorded.

Standard scans run inside an existing Codex conversation attach only the owner's
saved session; they do not record which subagents belong to the scan. Deep Scans
and scans launched by `codex-security` also attach their recorded execution
threads and descendants, without following unrelated children of the owner.

### Scan history and reruns

Commands default to the current repository. Select scans by full ID or a
unique prefix of at least eight characters.

New recipes retain resolved settings and the authentication choice, not
credentials. Reruns do not reload project files; complete saved deep settings do
not use current legacy defaults. Older partial recipes retain their previous
fallback behavior. Context paths and the current checkout are not immutable input
snapshots.

Reruns require replacement scan instructions when the original scan used them.
New recipes mark this requirement, and `scans rerun` refuses to omit them silently; use
`scans rerun [SCAN_ID] --scan-prompt-file FILE` to supply a nonempty replacement.
Replacement files resolve from the invocation directory. Custom validation keeps its existing
`scans rerun --validation-prompt-file` requirement.

| Command                                               | Purpose                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scans list [REPOSITORY]`                             | List scans. Filter by artifact root with `--scan-root DIR`.                                                 |
| `scans show [SCAN_ID]`                                | Show a scan; defaults to the latest completed one. `--show-linked-findings` includes earlier finding links. |
| `scans logs [SCAN_ID]`                                | Show session events; defaults to the latest scan, including active scans.                                   |
| `scans resume SCAN_ID`                                | Resume an interrupted Deep Scan in its original session and output directory.                               |
| `scans rerun [SCAN_ID]`                               | Repeat a scan on the current checkout; defaults to the latest completed scan.                               |
| `scans match BEFORE AFTER`                            | Link findings with the same root cause.                                                                     |
| `scans match --all`                                   | Match completed scans across the repository's worktrees and clones.                                         |
| `scans compare [BEFORE] [AFTER]`                      | Compare scans; defaults to the latest two completed scans.                                                  |
| `findings list [REPOSITORY]`                          | List open findings. `findings` is an alias.                                                                 |
| `findings false-positive OCCURRENCE_ID --reason TEXT` | Mark a false positive. Later scans dismiss matches only while the reason applies.                           |

#### Resuming an interrupted Deep Scan

After the CLI process or host stops unexpectedly, find the scan and rejoin it:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scans list --scan-root /path/to/security-scans
npx @openai/codex-security scans resume SCAN_ID
```

The scan must still be `running`, with its original checkout, output directory,
and owning Codex session available in the same Codex Security state directory.
The checkout's identity, revision, and contents must match the saved target.
Completed, failed, and canceled scans cannot resume; `scans rerun` starts a new scan.

Resume uses the saved configuration and instructions with the installed plugin.
New scans save the selected authentication mode, explicit safety identifier, and
post-scan prompt contents. Resume restores the authentication choice without
saving credentials. Single-scan resume restores the prompt even if its original
file changes or disappears.
Older records that did not save these values cannot reconstruct them. Bulk
recovery still requires matching campaign inputs and options; it uses the supplied
post-scan prompt when the scan has no saved prompt.
It keeps the scan ID, completed workers, artifacts, and accumulated session cost.
The existing coordinator recovers interrupted workers after its lease expires.
If discovery finished before the interruption, resume completes and seals the
same scan. No archiving or new attempt directory is needed. A failed connection
leaves the existing scan available for another resume attempt.

Compatible saved scans can resume after a plugin update. Already-sealed results
keep their original producer version and contents when completion is recorded.
Unsupported or invalid sealed artifacts are rejected before resuming, preserving
the saved scan state and files.

For bulk campaigns, use [`bulk-scan --recover`](#recovering-failed-or-interrupted-bulk-scans)
to recover eligible attempts and update `results.jsonl`. Individual `scans resume`
does not update campaign receipts.

#### Matching saved scans

Matching requires sealed artifacts and reuses saved matches unless you pass
`--force`. Comparisons classify findings as new, persisting, reopened, resolved,
or unknown. Missing findings aren't resolved if the later scan is incomplete
or excludes their original scope. With one ID, `scans compare` compares it
to the latest completed scan.

Use `scans match --all --force` to rebuild comparisons chronologically while
retaining stable finding identities. Ctrl-C keeps comparisons already saved.
Only high-confidence duplicates are grouped; uncertain and independently
related findings stay separate. Matching preserves triage and sealed artifacts.

Codex is called only when a new decision is needed, using existing authentication.
Scans without sealed artifacts are skipped, but their confirmed links can still
be reused. Older custom plugins save confirmed and uncertain matches; use the
bundled plugin for related links and large comparisons.

SDK callers can compare findings without saving a workbench comparison:

```ts
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";
import {
  matchScanFindings,
  type FindingsDocument,
} from "@openai/codex-security";

const before = JSON.parse(
  await readFile("/path/to/earlier-scan/findings.json", "utf8"),
) as FindingsDocument;
const after = JSON.parse(
  await readFile("/path/to/later-scan/findings.json", "utf8"),
) as FindingsDocument;

const comparison = await matchScanFindings(
  { before: before.findings, after: after.findings },
  { workingDirectory: "/path/to/repository" },
);
console.log(comparison.matches, comparison.uncertain, comparison.related ?? []);
```

Pass `knownFindingGroups` to reuse confirmed groups of stable `findingId` values
from your store. Results identify the original `occurrenceId` values. Options
include model, reasoning effort, `AbortSignal`, and an optional `onProgress`
callback whose errors do not interrupt matching.

History lives in `$CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR/workbench.sqlite3`, or
`$CODEX_HOME/state/plugins/codex-security/workbench.sqlite3`. The CLI and
workbench maintain the database and its journal files as the current user.
Keep state private, writable, and outside the scanned repository.

On Windows, an older sandboxed run can leave an invalid credential-home ancestor
ACL. Preserve that state and its reports, and select a **new**, private
`CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR` outside both the old state and the repository.
Sign in again if needed and keep using the new setting; it starts separate scan
history. Existing ancestor ACLs are not rewritten.

Scan configurations don't store credentials; session logs and live details can
contain them. Press `d` during a scan for details, then `a` for all sources,
`m` for the main scan, or `1` through `9` for a worker.

### Exports and CI

`export` writes CSV, JSON, or SARIF from a completed, sealed scan, defaulting to
the current repository's latest completed scan. It doesn't start Codex or load
credentials. Use `--output -` for stdout and `--source-root PATH` to add SARIF
source-line fingerprints. `export --help` lists all options.

JSON preserves the sealed findings document. CSV marks findings as open,
omits local triage state, and cannot go to stdout when JSON output is requested.

For CI, save output outside the checkout and set a severity threshold:

```bash
SCAN_ROOT="$(mktemp -d)"
npx @openai/codex-security scan . \
  --diff origin/main \
  --output-dir "$SCAN_ROOT/results" \
  --json \
  --fail-on-severity high > "$SCAN_ROOT/findings.json"
```

Scan exit codes are `0` for a completed report-only scan or passing policy,
`1` for a policy violation, `2` for invalid input, incomplete coverage, or a
runtime/export error, `130` for interruption, and `143` for termination.
JSON scans do not use interactive controls. `validate`, `login`, and `logout`
reject `--json`.

`install-hook` adds an optional local Git pre-commit check for staged and
unstaged changes. It's advisory; use a required CI check to enforce a passing
scan. When Git runs the hook, it blocks commits if the scan can't finish or
finds an issue at or above the threshold (`high` by default). Set it when
installing with `--fail-on-severity`. The installer respects `core.hooksPath`
and leaves custom hooks alone.

We recommend installing the CLI outside the repository and running that copy
directly. For a global installation:

```bash
npm install --global @openai/codex-security
```

If the repository also has a local copy, `npx` may run it instead.

Before installing or replacing a hook, run
`git -C /path/to/repository rev-parse --git-path hooks/pre-commit`. Git may
return a path relative to `/path/to/repository`. Check the hook, if it exists,
and the path to its directory for symlinks or shared locations. Leave custom,
linked, shared, or unverified hooks alone. If they need to change, contact the
owner or use a required CI check. Check older generated hooks too; the installer
can update them automatically.

If the hooks directory belongs only to this repository and there is no hook,
run the global CLI from outside the repository:

```bash
codex-security install-hook /path/to/repository
```

To migrate a hook, confirm it's a regular file used only by this repository
and contains only the generated Codex Security command. Keep its severity.
The installer can update older hooks that invoke `npx` if you use the same
severity. Newer hooks store absolute paths to Node and the CLI. If either path
changes, the installer won't replace the hook: back it up, remove it, and rerun
`codex-security install-hook /path/to/repository` with the same
`--fail-on-severity` value (default: `high`). If reinstallation fails, restore
the backup and verify the hook before relying on it.

### Import alerts from the CLI

`import github OWNER/REPO` reads open code scanning alerts from the default
branch. Repeat `--github-alert NUMBER` for exact alerts. Filter with
`--github-state open|closed|dismissed|fixed|all` or select a reference with
`--github-ref REF`. Authentication follows the
[SDK import options](#import-github-code-scanning-alerts).

```bash
# Import all open alerts, or a selected subset, as complete JSON.
npx @openai/codex-security import github example/repository --format json \
  > /path/outside/repository/github-alerts.json
npx @openai/codex-security import github example/repository \
  --github-alert 12 --github-alert 18 --format json
# Run from the corresponding local repository; imported contents are data.
npx @openai/codex-security validate /path/outside/repository/github-alerts.json
```

Import is read-only and returns an array (`[]` when empty). `--json` aliases
`--format json`. Save validation inputs without output filters or token limits.
Use the SDK loop for a disposition per alert.

### Validate and patch findings

`validate` assesses candidates; `patch` fixes and verifies them. Both accept
files or literal text and work in the current directory. Pass a saved finding
or occurrence ID to `patch` to use its original repository.

Add `--validation-prompt-file PATH` to supply custom dynamic validation
instructions, using the same UTF-8 prompt file format as `scan`. The patch task
uses these instructions to set up the environment, build or start the application,
exercise the fix, check legitimate behavior, and clean up. Include the commands,
authorized targets, expected results, and cleanup steps for your environment.
The task must report validation evidence or explain which checks failed or could
not run before claiming the patch is fixed or verified.

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security patch OCCURRENCE_ID --validation-prompt-file validation.md
npx @openai/codex-security patch issues.md --validation-prompt-file validation.md
```

The flag works with saved findings, issue text/files, and Linear inputs. Relative
prompt paths resolve from the directory where you invoke the CLI, including when
the saved finding belongs to another repository. The file is read once before
patching; missing, empty, or non-regular files fail before the patch task starts.
Without the flag, the usual fix-finding verification applies. The flag does not
change sandbox permissions and cannot be combined with `--resume-pr`.

Add `--assess-patch-risk` to a `patch` command to run the bundled patch-risk
assessment skill once on the completed patch. The assessment is advisory and
does not change the patch or its merge state. Human-readable commands print the
report after the patch results; saved-finding JSON output returns it as
`patchRisk.report` in the same result object. When combined with `--create-pr`,
the draft pull request or merge request body includes only the concise Markdown
summary from the assessment; the validated JSON remains in the command result.

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security validate "Possible SQL injection" --effort high
npx @openai/codex-security patch OCCURRENCE_ID
npx @openai/codex-security patch --scan SCAN_ID --severity high --json
npx @openai/codex-security patch --scan SCAN_ID --severity high --create-pr
npx @openai/codex-security patch --scan SCAN_ID --assess-patch-risk --create-pr
npx @openai/codex-security patch --linear-issue SEC-123 --assess-patch-risk --create-pr
```

`--scan latest` selects the current repository's latest scan. Patch commands
support `--json`, including literal-text and file inputs. Change
the model with `--codex 'model="gpt-5.6-sol"'` or effort with `--effort high`.
Each finding gets its own saved Codex desktop task.

Before patching, the CLI runs a command with the task's sandbox policy. If the
sandbox cannot start, the command exits with a nonzero status and reports
`SANDBOX_UNAVAILABLE`. JSON errors include `ok: false`. A completed model response
with no repository changes fails with `NO_PATCH_APPLIED`. Results report `applied`,
`filesChanged`, and `files`; existing local changes do not count as patch changes.
These fields report file changes, not proof that the security issue is fixed.
Saved findings still require a verified result from the patch task.

For a controlled container that provides its own isolation, explicitly opt in:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security patch "Security issue" --external-sandbox --json
```

`--external-sandbox` defaults to false. It uses Codex's external-sandbox policy
and prints a warning: Codex does not enforce filesystem or network isolation for
the patch task. The container must enforce those boundaries. The CLI never
falls back to this mode automatically. Optional patch-risk assessment still uses
its read-only Codex sandbox.

`scan --patch` patches after a complete scan. `--patch-severity` defaults to
`low`; `high` selects high and critical findings. Use the interactive browser
to select findings and add patch instructions. Results include a `patches`
entry per finding with status `verified`, `no_change`, `blocked`, or `failed`.
Verified and already-fixed findings no longer fail `--fail-on-severity`.
Patching shows each finding's position, elapsed time, and live Codex activity.
Progress goes to stderr; completed results stay in the terminal history.

`--create-pr` commits generated patch files and opens a draft GitHub pull request
with `gh` or a draft GitLab merge request with `glab`. Install and authenticate
the appropriate CLI first (`gh auth login` or `glab auth login`). GitLab.com is
selected from the `origin` push URL, including SSH URLs and subgroup projects.
For self-hosted GitLab, set `GITLAB_HOST` to the host in that URL and authenticate
with `glab auth login --hostname HOST`. The existing `GITLAB_URI` and `GL_HOST`
aliases are also accepted, in that order after `GITLAB_HOST`. Other hosts retain
the GitHub workflow.

```bash
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com npx @openai/codex-security patch --scan SCAN_ID --create-pr
```

Both providers use the existing `pullRequest: { branch, url }` JSON result.
Supplied-issue requests require a clean working tree before patching so
existing work is never included. If publication fails, run the printed
`patch --resume-pr BRANCH` command in the same repository. It reuses the saved
commit without rerunning Codex, but refuses to publish if the branch changed.
Use the same GitLab host setting when resuming a self-hosted merge request.

To patch Linear issues, repeat `--linear-issue ISSUE` (ID or URL), or use
`--linear-project "PROJECT"` with an optional native JSON `--linear-filter`.
Completed and canceled issues are excluded unless the filter sets `state`.
Use `CODEX_SECURITY_LINEAR_API_KEY` or `LINEAR_API_KEY` for an API key, or
`LINEAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` for OAuth. `--linear-api-key KEY` overrides these; prefer
environment variables to keep keys out of shell history. Intake is read-only,
includes comments, and keeps Linear credentials out of the patch subprocess.
Issue URLs must match the selected workspace.

### Verify fixes

`verify-fix` checks fixes in a read-only sandbox. Pass a description, saved
finding ID, `--scan SCAN_ID`, `--linear-issue ISSUE`, or `--linear-project "PROJECT"`.
Linear credentials and filters work as for `patch`. To check a finished backlog,
explicitly filter for completed issues.

Results include evidence and a status: `fixed`, `still_vulnerable`, or
`inconclusive`. Use `--json` for structured output. Exit codes are `0` if all
findings are fixed, `1` if any remain vulnerable, and `2` if verification is
inconclusive or couldn't finish.

### Command discovery and integrations

The CLI uses [Incur](https://github.com/wevm/incur). Use `--llms` for the
command manifest, `scan --schema --format json` for a command schema, and
`completions bash|zsh|fish` for shell completions. Scan output supports
`--format toon|json|yaml|jsonl` and `--full-output`.

`skills add` syncs agent skills; `mcp add` registers the CLI as an MCP server.
MCP exposes only the read-only `info` command because the transport cannot
cancel active scans.

## Findings service (preview)

The findings API uses the same `ghcr.io/openai/codex-security` image as the
scanner, for Linux `amd64` and `arm64`. `compose.findings.yaml` starts the API
in a separate container with its own state volume and server configuration.
Once a release is published, it can be pulled without a GitHub login. See
[container release setup](../../docker/README.md) for the required maintainer
setup and publication process.

From the repository root, copy the example if you do not already have a `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`, then pull and start the findings API:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.findings.yaml pull
docker compose -f compose.findings.yaml up --no-build -d
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/findings
```

You can deploy with just `compose.findings.yaml` and a private `.env`; no source
checkout or Node.js installation is required. `CODEX_SECURITY_FINDINGS_IMAGE`
defaults to `ghcr.io/openai/codex-security:latest`. Set it to a published
version, `sha-<commit>` tag, or digest for repeatable deployments.

To build from a source checkout, first prepare the
[universal native payload](../../plugins/codex-security/native/README.md#package-inputs)
for that checkout. Then run from the repository root:

```bash
docker build --target scanner -t codex-security:local .
export CODEX_SECURITY_FINDINGS_IMAGE=codex-security:local
docker compose -f compose.findings.yaml up --no-build -d
```

For an existing deployment using the separate findings image or
`--target findings-service`, follow the [single-image migration guide](../../docker/README.md#migrating-the-findings-service).

### Read-only dashboard

Open `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` on the running findings service. The UI
uses the public OpenAI Apps SDK UI design system, follows the browser's light
or dark preference, and polls the service every five seconds. It never starts,
cancels, resumes, publishes, edits, or deduplicates anything.

The dashboard opens on Findings, followed by Duplicate groups. Both views
support search, repository filtering, sorting, pagination, and record details.
Click any column header to sort all matching records; click it again to reverse
the order. The arrow marks the active column and direction. Changing the sort
returns to the first page, and automatic refreshes keep the selected order.
By default, findings sort by last update descending, then severity descending,
then ID ascending to break ties. Groups sort by last update descending and ID
ascending.
Findings show stored content and links to their duplicate groups. Groups link
back to their member findings, preserving separate overlapping groups and the
original finding records.

The dashboard reads only findings, repository associations, and duplicate groups
stored in the service's configured database. It does not display scans or
workflows: publication sends findings, not remote scan or workflow history. It
does not read report or source paths from stored records. The UI retains the last
successful data on a refresh failure and shows a connection warning until polling
succeeds.

`GET /v1/dashboard` returns a consistent read snapshot with overview counts,
repository choices, a page of records, and optional selected-record details:

- `view`: `findings` (default) or `groups`.
- `query`, `repository`: optional search text and exact repository ID.
- `sort`: `activity` (default; last update), `newest` (created), `title`,
  `repository`, `severity` (findings only), or `members` (groups only).
- `direction`: `asc` or `desc` (default). Text sorts alphabetically without
  case sensitivity, severity by level, and member counts numerically.
- `limit`, `offset`: existing pagination conventions, defaulting to 50 and 0.
- `id`: optional exact record ID to include in `detail`; unknown IDs return
  `detail: null` without hiding the list.

Overview counts are service-wide, not filtered page totals. Responses and UI
assets are served by the same Node process; no separate frontend server, CDN,
model credentials, or new CLI flags are needed to view the dashboard. Compiled
HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are included in the npm package and container. Frontend
source, build tools, and tests are not shipped as runtime dependencies.

The existing preview access boundary is unchanged. The dashboard contains
sensitive finding content: keep the service on a trusted local endpoint or behind
an authenticated proxy. It does not add authentication or broaden the default
network binding.

### API

`POST /v1/bulk/findings` accepts `{"findings": [...]}`, using the existing SDK
`Finding` model, including `findingId`, `occurrenceId`, and `fingerprints`.
A complete exported `findings.json` document is also accepted; only its
`findings` array is imported. No files or source paths referenced by the
findings are opened. Only the supplied JSON is processed.

Include `repositoryId` alongside `findings` to associate every imported finding
with a repository. For SDK/CLI scans, use `scan.target.targetId` from the sealed
`scan-manifest.json`. IDs are matched exactly; the service does not infer a
repository from titles, paths, or URLs. Reimports add associations without
removing earlier ones, so a finding can belong to more than one repository.
Imports without this metadata remain accepted, but unassociated findings are
only available to explicit all-repository retrieval until imported with an ID.

| Method | Path                                    | Response                                                                            |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/v1/bulk/findings`                     | HTTP 201 with an array of stored finding IDs, in request order                      |
| `GET`  | `/v1/findings?limit=50&offset=0`        | HTTP 200 with a page of complete findings                                           |
| `GET`  | `/v1/finding/{id}/potential-duplicates` | HTTP 200 with the stored finding and up to 50 potential duplicates, without vectors |
| `POST` | `/v1/dedupe-groups`                     | HTTP 201 with the persisted duplicate groups                                        |
| `GET`  | `/v1/finding/{id}/dedupe-groups`        | HTTP 200 with every stored group containing this finding                            |

Bulk insertion generates embeddings and then writes the findings and vectors
in one SQLite transaction. If embedding generation fails or a finding identity
conflicts with another stored identity, no part of the batch is written.
Reusing a `findingId` updates that finding and replaces its embedding; retries
do not create extra rows. An existing ID's fingerprint, rule, and identity
anchor/instance cannot be replaced. Repeated IDs in one request are applied in order,
with the last supplied record retained. Stored scan occurrences are unchanged.

For example, add `repositoryId` to a copy of an exported findings document
saved as `findings-import.json` (leave the sealed scan artifacts unchanged),
then import it with the API key configured before starting Compose:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/bulk/findings \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @findings-import.json
```

```json
["csf_852f90d6e1177502ff113d4a"]
```

The potential-duplicates response contains `finding` (the complete stored
anchor) and `potentialDuplicates` (an array of complete `Finding` records).
Neither includes embedding vectors. The anchor is not repeated in the array.
Specify one scope explicitly on the request:

```text
GET /v1/finding/{id}/potential-duplicates?repositoryId=target_sha256_example
GET /v1/finding/{id}/potential-duplicates?allRepositories=true
```

Repository scope requires the anchor and each candidate to be associated with
that repository. All-repository scope includes tagged and untagged findings.
Omitting scope or combining a repository with `allRepositories=true` returns
HTTP 400. Scope selects candidates; it is not an authorization boundary.

Candidates have cosine similarity at least 0.55 and the same embedding model
and dimensions as the anchor. They are ordered by descending similarity, with
ties resolved by insertion time and finding ID, and limited to 50. Each request
reads a current snapshot; separate requests do not share a database snapshot.
SQLite first filters repository associations, reads only IDs and embedding
vectors (plus the anchor's model), and performs exact cosine ranking. It then
loads complete documents only for the anchor and the selected top 50 candidates,
all within the same read transaction.
The API does not run Codex or decide whether candidates are duplicates.

### Publishing to a custom findings service

Publish a completed scan directly from the local CLI to the Docker service:

```bash
codex-security publish scan --scan SCAN_ID --to custom \
  --findings-url http://localhost:3000 --json
```

`--findings-url` is required for `--to custom`, with no default. It is the
service base URL, including `http://` or `https://`; the client appends
`/v1/bulk/findings`, preserving any base path. A different endpoint must
implement that API and return the stored finding IDs. The command sends the
complete sealed findings and their manifest's `scan.target.targetId` as
`repositoryId`, without changing scan artifacts or forwarding model credentials.
The service creates embeddings and commits the batch before acknowledging it.

The existing saved-scan selector, external `--scan-dir`, and interactive picker
work with custom publication. Custom publication accepts one scan, not CSV
input or Linear options. Add `--dry-run` to validate and preview the payload
without making an HTTP request. Existing Linear and Cloud destinations are
unchanged. Upload failures and incomplete receipts fail the command; uploads
are not automatically retried because a lost response may have been committed.

```typescript
import { publishScanToCustom } from "@openai/codex-security";

const receipt = await publishScanToCustom("/path/to/completed-scan", {
  findingsUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
  // dryRun: true,
  // signal: controller.signal,
});
console.log(receipt.repositoryId, receipt.findingIds);
```

### Deduplication from the SDK and CLI

Publish the scan with `--to custom` (or import it through the bulk API with its
`repositoryId`) before deduplicating. The
workflow reads a completed saved scan, queries candidates by finding ID, and
runs Luna and Sol in the calling SDK/CLI process. Once all reviews finish,
it posts accepted groups to the service. It does not re-upload findings or
change scan artifacts.

```bash
codex-security dedupe --scan SCAN_ID --findings-url http://127.0.0.1:3000 --json
```

Deduplication runs up to 8 jobs concurrently by default. Set `--concurrency N`
to choose a positive integer, or `--concurrency 1` for serial execution. The SDK
equivalent is `concurrency: N`. Candidate neighborhoods are fetched first, with
the same concurrency limit. Luna screenings and ready Sol pair reviews then use
two queues sharing one worker pool, with at most 8 jobs running in total by
default. Each available worker takes a ready job as soon as its current job
finishes; it does not wait for a batch to finish.

A Sol pair review becomes ready once every Luna screening covering that pair
has finished and none voted `DISTINCT`. It can run while unrelated Luna
screenings continue. Results are combined in input order so completion timing
does not change the groups.

An explicit model refusal keeps the affected pairs separate and allows unrelated
reviews to continue. It is recorded as `NO_DECISION`, not a reviewed `DISTINCT`
verdict. A screening refusal applies to every anchor/candidate pair in that
screening; a pair-review refusal applies only to its assigned pair. Neither pair
can be merged indirectly through other findings. Recognized policy errors and
explicit refusal responses are not retried or sent to another model.

If another kind of job fails after its retries, queued jobs stop and already running jobs
finish before the command reports the failure. No groups are posted from an
incomplete review. To retain completed reviews across runs, use a
`--workflow-id` as described below.

The default scope is the saved scan's repository, identified by
`scan.target.targetId` in its manifest. Add `--all-repositories` to search the
entire stored corpus explicitly; the flag defaults to false. The SDK has the
equivalent optional `allRepositories: true` setting. This narrows the previous
preview's implicit all-repository behavior.

Provide `--findings-url` and either `--scan` or `--workflow-id`, with no implicit
scan or service URL. As with `publish scan --scan`, the scan selector accepts a full ID, unique
prefix, or `latest` for the current repository. The saved scan must be complete
and its sealed artifacts must be available.

```typescript
import { deduplicateScan } from "@openai/codex-security";

const result = await deduplicateScan("scan_example_001", {
  findingsUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
  // concurrency: 8, // Shared worker limit for Luna and Sol; use 1 for serial.
  // allRepositories: true, // Omit to search only this scan's repository.
  // signal: controller.signal,
});
console.log(result.duplicateGroups);
```

For a complete, sealed scan directory that is not registered in local scan
history, provide the repository checkout separately:

```typescript
import { deduplicateScanDirectory } from "@openai/codex-security";

const result = await deduplicateScanDirectory("/path/to/completed-scan", {
  repository: "/path/to/repository",
  findingsUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
  // concurrency: 8,
  // expectedScanId: "scan_example_001",
  // allRepositories: true,
  // signal: controller.signal,
});
console.log(result.duplicateGroups);
```

The CLI and SDK return the same result:

```json
{
  "scanId": "scan_example_001",
  "uniqueFindingIds": ["csf_852f90d6e1177502ff113d4a"],
  "duplicateGroups": [],
  "deduplicationStatus": "completed"
}
```

`uniqueFindingIds` contains one representative for each selected finding after
accepted duplicate groups are collapsed. A representative can be an existing
stored finding outside the scan. Each `duplicateGroups` entry contains all
members of an accepted group, with its canonical finding first. The canonical
has the highest reported severity; ties use finding ID. Results do not delete,
merge, or change stored finding documents. Accepted groups are saved as durable
associations in the service before `deduplicationStatus` becomes `completed`.

When any review is refused, the result instead has
`deduplicationStatus: "completed_with_refusals"` and a `refusals` array. Each
entry contains `decision: "NO_DECISION"`, `stage`, `model`, `findingIds`, and
`reason`. For screening, the first finding ID is the anchor and the remaining
IDs are its candidates. The CLI logs each refusal to stderr and exits
successfully after saving the accepted groups. SDK callers can inspect and log
the same structured entries. Findings retained because of a refusal are not
confirmed unique. Successful runs without refusals keep their existing output
shape. No command, flag, or default changes are required.

This behavior applies to post-scan Luna/Sol deduplication. Deep Scan's internal
reducer uses a separate workflow.

### Host-provided records deduplication

`codex-security dedupe --records` accepts a versioned JSON-RPC run over stdin
and emits serial `review.run` requests on stdout for a host-provided model
backend. It requires no saved scan or Findings API and performs no local model
execution or persistence. The SDK exposes `deduplicateRecords(input,
{ reviewRunner, signal })`. The input contains original observations and explicit candidate links. Results
contain groups of observation IDs and unresolved observations.

See the [records protocol and Python fake-host example](docs/dedupe-records.md)
for the complete input, review contract, cancellation, and persistence rules.

### Stored duplicate groups

`POST /v1/dedupe-groups` accepts a batch of explicitly reviewed member sets:

```json
{
  "groups": [
    ["csf_000000000000000000000001", "csf_000000000000000000000002"],
    ["csf_000000000000000000000002", "csf_000000000000000000000003"]
  ]
}
```

Each group must contain at least two distinct, existing finding IDs. The entire
batch is committed in one transaction; a missing finding returns HTTP 409 and
writes none of the batch. A response contains `groupId`, `findingIds`, and
`createdAt` for each group. Group identity depends on membership, not member
order, so submitting the same set again returns its original ID and timestamp.

SQLite stores groups in `finding_dedupe_groups` and memberships in
`finding_dedupe_group_members`. A finding may belong to multiple groups:
`[A, B]`, `[B, C]`, and `[C, A]` are three separate reviewed sets. Overlapping
groups are not automatically united or promoted into an unreviewed larger
group. Stored members are sorted by ID; their order does not designate a
canonical. The CLI result retains its existing canonical-first ordering.

`GET /v1/finding/{id}/dedupe-groups` returns every group containing that finding,
including each group's full membership, or `[]` if it has no groups. These
associations do not rewrite original findings, fingerprints, scan artifacts,
embeddings, or external tickets. They do not require an embedding API key or
trigger model calls. Review-generated merged findings remain review outputs;
they do not replace stored documents.

### Resuming a local findings workflow

Add `--workflow-id` to opt into durable state shared by `scan`, `publish scan
--to custom`, and `dedupe`. The SDK equivalents are the optional `workflowId`
fields on `ScanOptions`, `PublishScanToCustomOptions`, and `DeduplicateScanOptions`.
Without a workflow ID, existing command behavior and output shapes are unchanged.

```bash
codex-security scan /path/to/repository --workflow-id run-001
codex-security publish scan --workflow-id run-001 --to custom --findings-url http://localhost:3000
codex-security dedupe --workflow-id run-001 --findings-url http://localhost:3000 --json
```

Repeat this sequence with the same ID after a process stops. Completed scans and
acknowledged publications are reused; unfinished stages run again. If the scan
completed before the workflow recorded its receipt, recovery verifies the saved
scan and its sealed artifacts instead of scanning again. Scan IDs and artifact
locations are recorded in the scan-registration transaction. This resumes between
completed steps; it does not resume individual model turns inside an unfinished
scan. Existing output-directory and archive safeguards still apply to scan retries.

Publication and dedupe can use the workflow ID in place of `--scan`; an explicit
scan selector must identify that same scan. A workflow can also begin at custom
publication of a completed scan. The CLI and `deduplicateScan` require local scan
history to locate the approved source checkout; `deduplicateScanDirectory` uses
the supplied repository. For a workflow, dedupe first completes publication
if its receipt is missing. `--all-repositories` retains its existing default of
false. Changing a workflow's scan, destination, or bound scope is an error: choose
a different workflow ID. Use one coordinating process per workflow.

Workflow metadata, stage statuses, errors, publication receipts, and results live
in the local workbench SQLite database under `CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR`, outside
the sealed scan artifacts. Identity, scan/artifact references, destination, scope,
hashes, stage statuses, and errors use explicit columns; only receipts and result
payloads use JSON. Review source, scope, model settings, and contract/hash bindings
also use columns; review results remain JSON. Existing workflows and checkpoints
are migrated atomically in place without changing their review keys.
Successful empty results are stored as completed
results, not treated as missing work. An empty scan can complete workflow
publication with an empty receipt. Dry-run never advances a workflow stage.

A completed `dedupe --workflow-id` returns its saved result without repeating
reviews or group writes. A publication whose acknowledgement was lost is retried
using the service's existing idempotent upsert.

Concurrent jobs save their validated reviews independently. Resuming with the
same workflow ID reuses completed reviews and retries unfinished jobs. The
concurrency setting is not part of a review's checkpoint identity, so it is safe
to change `--concurrency` when resuming. Cancellation stops active reviews and
leaves their completed checkpoints available for the next run.

Each validated screening and pair review is checkpointed locally,
including DISTINCT decisions. Screening checkpoints retain pair recommendations
and rationales under host-assigned pair slots bound to the original records.
Every SAME pair-review checkpoint retains its
required `canonicalFindingId` and generated `mergedFinding`; the merged record
must satisfy the Finding schema and preserve the canonical finding ID. Validation
still happens through `review_validator.submit_decisions`; invalid submissions
are corrected in the same review conversation. A completed turn without an
accepted submission receives one corrective turn in that same conversation.
If formatting remains invalid, the job retries in a fresh review session.
Explicit transient Codex failures and unexpected process exits also retry, with
at most three fresh sessions per review. Transient findings-service failures, including
rate limits and network errors, receive up to three request attempts. Retries use
exponential backoff with jitter; HTTP retries honor `Retry-After`. Waiting to retry
occupies the job's concurrency slot.

Cancellation, authentication or configuration errors, permanent HTTP errors, and
required-source-access blockers are not retried. Model refusals continue with
`NO_DECISION` as described above. Other exhausted retries fail deduplication;
invalid or unfinished reviews are not cached. Completed checkpoints remain
available when the workflow resumes.

Refusals are not saved as validated review checkpoints. A completed workflow
retains its final `completed_with_refusals` result, including all refusal entries,
and returns it on subsequent calls. To attempt those reviews again after
resolving the refusal, run dedupe without that workflow ID or with a new one.

Checkpoints bind to the exact original records and ordering, approved source path,
Git revision and current file contents (including ignored files), repository scope,
model and reasoning settings, Codex configuration and version, and prompt/contract version. Changed
inputs cause a new review rather than reusing a decision. Source changes during
review stop that attempt before group writes; restart with the same ID to review
the changed source. Original findings, never prior rationales or merged findings,
are supplied to later independent reviews. Source snapshots do not follow directory
links outside the approved checkout.

Before posting groups, the workflow saves the exact final result and write payload.
If posting fails or its acknowledgement is lost, rerunning dedupe replays that
payload without looking up candidates or running models. Group persistence reuses
the existing membership identity, so replay does not create another group. The
dedupe stage completes only after acknowledgement. Empty results are also retained.
A completed workflow or pending write represents its already reviewed snapshot;
use another workflow ID for a fresh review rather than changing that saved result.

### Deduplication workflow

1. For each distinct finding ID in the scan, request
   `/v1/finding/{id}/potential-duplicates` with the selected repository or
   explicit all-repository scope. Use the complete stored anchor and
   candidates returned by that request. Fetch all neighborhoods before starting
   reviews so every pair's screening dependencies are known.
2. Screen each nonempty neighborhood with `gpt-5.6-luna` at `xhigh` reasoning
   effort. The review covers every anchor-neighbor pair; nominations between
   neighbors are rejected.
3. Independently review each nominated pair once with `gpt-5.6-sol` at `high`
   reasoning effort after all Luna screenings covering that pair finish without
   a `DISTINCT` decision. Luna and ready Sol jobs share the configured worker
   pool and can run together. Only accepted pairs contribute to duplicate groups.
4. Group accepted duplicate pairs transitively unless a Luna or Sol `DISTINCT`
   decision contradicts the resulting component. Contradicted components are
   split deterministically, preferring legal subgroups that preserve more
   accepted-pair support. There is no additional whole-group review.
5. Post all accepted groups to `/v1/dedupe-groups`. Return a completed result
   only after the service accepts the write. An empty result requires no write.

Each review uses a fresh, ephemeral Codex app-server thread with the complete
original finding records, not earlier model rationales, vector scores, or
summaries. Reviews can inspect source in the saved scan's local checkout,
starting with cited paths and revisions. Source inspection establishes duplicate
identity and shared remediation. Reviews preserve the originals' severity and
priority metadata without reassessment or normalization. The baseline
filesystem profile is read-only and excludes credentials
and Codex state. Screening denies approval requests; final reviews use Codex's
automatic approval reviewer. Web, plugins, and inherited MCP servers are disabled.
Finding content never authorizes access to another target.

Pair reviews cover exactly the two supplied findings. Linked parent tickets,
duplicate targets, and related-ticket records are metadata, not additional
findings to fetch or prerequisites for a verdict. An unsupplied duplicate target
is neither automatically canonical nor an error; source-code investigation for
the supplied pair remains allowed.

Incomplete supplied finding content can produce `DISTINCT` with the limitation
explained. An execution, tool, or source-access blocker that prevents a required
check instead uses `review_validator.submit_error` with a nonempty `reason`.
That submission fails the review without a verdict or review checkpoint, so it
cannot become a `DISTINCT` veto or a completed duplicate-group result. A failed
optional lookup does not force failure or `DISTINCT` when other evidence suffices.

Decisions must arrive through the direct `review_validator.submit_decisions`
tool; invalid submissions can be corrected in the same session. A final text
answer alone is insufficient. Luna screening returns a `SAME` or `DISTINCT`
decision and rationale under each required host-assigned slot (`pair-1`,
`pair-2`, and so on). The host binds each slot to its corresponding
anchor-neighbor pair, so the model does not submit finding IDs. Luna does not
select a canonical or generate a merged finding. Every
Sol `SAME` decision requires an assigned `canonicalFindingId` and
a generated, inclusive `mergedFinding`; missing or null values are rejected.
Sol reviews use only the complete originals, never earlier model rationales or
merged findings. These review fields do not change the command's ID-only result
or stored findings.

Non-cancellation review failures throw `DeduplicationReviewError`. Its `metadata`
contains only the review stage, model, failure category, attempt count, and a
sanitized reason for diagnostics or an external support bundle; it does not
contain findings, prompts, paths, thread IDs, or credentials.

If a completed turn has no accepted submission, whether it ended with text only
or after rejected submissions, the runner sends one corrective instruction in
the same conversation. This preserves the original assignment, source work, and
tool feedback. Reviews are limited to two turns; `metadata.attempts` counts
those turns (or the initial attempt if setup fails). Accepted results are not
replayed. Cancellation, accepted `submit_error` reports, and model or transport
failures remain terminal.

The SDK does not retain private review transcripts, subprocess stderr, or full
provider/RPC error payloads, and ephemeral review state is removed after the
session. The public metadata is a limited diagnostic summary, not a complete
troubleshooting trace; it intentionally omits the original error cause. Private
diagnostic retention is not currently implemented.

Model calls run sequentially on the SDK/CLI host using its Codex sign-in or
`OPENAI_API_KEY`/`CODEX_API_KEY`, with access to the configured models. Model
credentials are not sent to the findings API. Larger scans can take time and
incur multiple model calls per finding. Empty scans and findings without
eligible neighbors do not invoke review models. `completed` means this
retrieval, review, and group persistence completed, not that every possible pair in the
database was compared or that model decisions are infallible. An API, review, or write-back
failure fails the command without claiming a completed result. Retry after
fixing the failure; stored findings remain unchanged. A lost write-back response
may have committed groups; retrying the same memberships does not duplicate
them. Failed or interrupted reviews write no groups. The CLI supports Ctrl-C
and SIGTERM, and the SDK accepts an `AbortSignal`.

### Listing and errors

Listing defaults to `limit=50` and `offset=0`; `limit` must be a positive
integer and `offset` a non-negative integer. Records are ordered by their first
insertion time, then finding ID. Follow `nextOffset` until it is `null`:

```json
{
  "findings": [],
  "limit": 50,
  "offset": 0,
  "total": 0,
  "nextOffset": null
}
```

The list includes API imports and complete finding documents from existing CLI
scan history. It returns the latest stored document for each finding ID,
without embedding vectors. Legacy identities without a complete document are
not included. Pagination reflects current database contents, not a snapshot
held between HTTP requests.

Malformed JSON, invalid finding objects, repository metadata, groups, scopes, and pagination return HTTP
400 (`invalid_request`). Identity conflicts or missing dedupe group members return 409 (`finding_conflict`),
embedding provider failures or unusable vectors return 502 (`embedding_failed`),
and missing embedding credentials return 503 (`embedding_unavailable`). A
potential-duplicates query without a current embedding returns 404
(`finding_not_indexed`), including findings outside the requested repository or
whose embedding was invalidated by an update; import the finding with the
matching `repositoryId` before retrying. This is an error, not an
empty candidate list. Unknown routes return 404 (`not_found`); unexpected
server failures return 500 (`internal_error`). Errors have an `error` code and,
for expected failures, a `message`. Request bodies and provider error bodies
are not logged.

### Embeddings and storage

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the repository-root `.env`, using `.env.example` as a
template, or export `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_API_KEY` in the host environment.
Compose passes the key to the service; exported values override `.env` values.
The `.env` file is excluded from Git and Docker builds. `OPENAI_API_KEY` takes
precedence over `CODEX_API_KEY`; remove the `OPENAI_API_KEY` entry if using
`CODEX_API_KEY` instead. Listing and empty imports do not require a key.
A Codex ChatGPT login is not an embedding API credential.

Set `CODEX_SECURITY_EMBEDDINGS_URL` to override the full embeddings endpoint URL,
including its path and any query parameters. Unset or empty values use
`https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings`. Export it before `codex-security serve`,
or set it in `.env` for Docker Compose, which passes it to the service. For example:

```bash
CODEX_SECURITY_EMBEDDINGS_URL=https://embeddings.example.com/v1/embeddings codex-security serve
```

The configured endpoint receives the finding inputs and the API key as a bearer
token and must support the same OpenAI embeddings request and response format.

The service calls the OpenAI embeddings API with `text-embedding-3-large` and
1,536 dimensions. The complete finding JSON is tokenized using `js-tiktoken`'s
bundled `cl100k_base` encoding. Long inputs are split without truncation;
their vectors are combined by token weight and normalized. Requests respect
the provider's 8,192-token input, 300,000-token request, and 2,048-input limits.
See the [embedding API contract](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/embeddings/methods/create).

Storage initializes before the server listens. The SQLite adapter reuses the
bundled workbench's schema and migrations at
`$CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR/workbench.sqlite3`. An append-only migration adds
complete finding documents and an embedding table, while retaining the existing
finding identity table and scan history. Both the API and current CLI indexing
use the same finding upsert operation. Changing a stored document invalidates
its old embedding so later matching cannot use a stale vector. Historical
findings are not automatically embedded; submit them to a bulk endpoint first.

The `findings-state` named volume persists `/state`, including the database,
across container replacements. Keep the same Compose project name to reuse it.
The image runs as UID/GID `10001:10001`; a bind mount must be writable by that
UID/GID if used instead of the named volume.

Stop the service with
`docker compose -f compose.findings.yaml down`; add `--volumes` only when you
intend to delete the stored data.

The findings Compose configuration sets `HOST=0.0.0.0`, `PORT=3000`, and
`CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR=/state`. Keep port and volume mappings aligned if
changing these settings. Compose binds only to host loopback; the API has no
authentication. Use an authenticated TLS proxy before sharing access. Finding
JSON is sent to the configured embeddings endpoint (`api.openai.com` over HTTPS
by default); the database and generated embeddings stay in the local volume.

### Upgrades and backups

Read the release notes and stop the service before backing up the entire
`/state` directory. For the published-image Compose configuration:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.findings.yaml stop findings
mkdir -p backups
chmod 700 backups
docker compose -f compose.findings.yaml run --rm --no-deps --user 0:0 \
  --entrypoint tar -T findings -C /state -czf - . > backups/findings-state.tgz
chmod 600 backups/findings-state.tgz
```

Keep backups separately; this command overwrites an existing backup of the same
name. Set `CODEX_SECURITY_FINDINGS_IMAGE` to the new version or digest and repeat
the pull/start commands above, retaining the volume. Startup applies SQLite
migrations automatically. To roll back, stop the service, restore the pre-upgrade
backup, and select the previous image digest; an older image may not support the
migrated database.

### Running without Docker

With Node.js and Python 3 installed:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex-security
CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR="$HOME/.codex-security-findings" codex-security serve --port 3000
```

`--port` overrides `PORT` (default: `3000`). Open
`http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard`. Stop with Ctrl+C or SIGTERM.

Export `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_API_KEY` to import findings with embeddings.
Startup and listing need no key. The service does not load `.env` or authenticate
requests; keep it on loopback or behind an authenticated TLS proxy.

For a source build, first prepare the
[universal native payload](../../plugins/codex-security/native/README.md#package-inputs)
for that checkout. Then run from its `sdk/typescript` directory:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir ../../plugins/codex-security/mcp-app install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run build:plugin
pnpm run build
node bin/codex-security.mjs serve --port 3000
```

`pnpm run start:server` and `node dist/server/index.js` still work.

Local defaults are `HOST=127.0.0.1` and `PORT=3000`. The existing
`CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR` and `PYTHON` settings select storage and Python;
without a state override, the service uses the same default state directory as
the CLI. These settings also work on Windows.

HTTP routing, orchestration, embedding generation, and the SQLite adapter live
separately under `src/server/`. `FindingsService` receives a `FindingEmbedder`
whose `embed(findings)` method returns one `{ model, vector }` per finding in
input order. `OpenAiFindingEmbedder` handles tokenization, batching, API calls,
and vector normalization; it does not access storage. The `FindingsStore`
interface stores findings and vectors and exposes
`findPotentialDuplicates(findingId, scope)`. Repository filtering, vector ranking,
and fetching selected documents stay inside the store implementation; replacing
SQLite with an indexed store does not change the service or SDK/CLI. Repository
associations are stored separately from finding documents, with an append-only
migration that also imports known associations from stored scan occurrences.
New scan findings retain their target associations when indexed locally.
The server entrypoint selects the concrete
embedder and store, so either can be replaced independently.

For renewable embeddings credentials, import `OpenAiFindingEmbedder`,
`SqliteFindingsStore`, and `startFindingsServer` from
`@openai/codex-security/server`. The embedder's first argument accepts a static
key or `() => string | Promise<string>`. It calls the callback before every
HTTP batch, including subsequent calls to `embed`; callers own token acquisition.
Pass `fetch` as the second argument and
`process.env.CODEX_SECURITY_EMBEDDINGS_URL || undefined` as the third to use
the same full endpoint URL and default as `codex-security serve`. Importing the
server API does not start a listener.

The local workflow lives under `src/deduplication/`. `FindingDeduplicator`
receives a candidate API client and a `DeduplicationReviewer`, keeping grouping
separate from HTTP and model transport. `CodexDeduplicationReviewer` owns prompts
and result validation; `CodexReviewRunner` owns app-server sessions and cleanup.
`deduplicateScan` validates saved scan artifacts before running the workflow;
`deduplicateScanDirectory` performs the same validation for an explicit sealed
scan directory without consulting local scan history.
The SDK reuses the existing Codex runtime and credentials without additional
runtime dependencies.

## Containerized bulk scans

Create `repositories.csv` as described under [Bulk scans](#bulk-scans).
With a published image, run from the Codex Security repository root:

```bash
mkdir -p results state
chmod 700 results state
export CODEX_SECURITY_USER="$(id -u):$(id -g)"
export CODEX_SECURITY_IMAGE=ghcr.io/openai/codex-security:latest
docker compose pull codex-security
docker compose run --rm codex-security login --device-auth
docker compose run --rm codex-security
```

Results go to `results/`; device login stays in `state/`. For unattended scans,
set `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_API_KEY`. Private GitHub checkouts use `GH_TOKEN`
or `GITHUB_TOKEN`; GitHub Enterprise uses `CODEX_SECURITY_GIT_HOST`. The container
requires CSV input, without interactive discovery.

Compose accepts `CODEX_SECURITY_IMAGE`, `CODEX_SECURITY_USER`,
`CODEX_SECURITY_SECCOMP`, `CODEX_SECURITY_CSV`, `CODEX_SECURITY_RESULTS`, and
`CODEX_SECURITY_STATE` for the image, user, seccomp profile, and mounts.

Codex 0.156.1 requires Bubblewrap for filesystem-restricted execution on Linux.
On Ubuntu hosts that restrict unprivileged user namespaces, an administrator
must install the AppArmor profile and use the Compose override:

```bash
sudo install -m 0644 docker/codex-security.apparmor /etc/apparmor.d/codex-security-container
sudo apparmor_parser -r -W /etc/apparmor.d/codex-security-container
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.apparmor.yaml run --rm codex-security
```

The override keeps the nonroot user, dropped capabilities, no-new-privileges,
and seccomp policy. It enables the nested namespaces required by Bubblewrap.
The legacy Landlock fallback is no longer supported for these scans. Other
Docker hosts that permit nested user namespaces do not need this override.

## Local security model

Codex Security runs with your operating-system permissions. Only scan
repositories you trust and are authorized to assess. Local tools and scans
under the same account aren't separate security principals.

The `codex_security_scan` profile allows reads across the local filesystem and
writes to workspace roots. Execution approvals are reviewed automatically and
may grant extra permissions for one operation. Set
`--codex 'approval_policy="never"'`, directly or in a selected profile, to deny
requests. Other overrides can't replace the reviewer or filesystem profile.
Saved scans keep their approval policy; older scans stay deny-all on rerun.
Host and network restrictions still apply.

Start scans with only the credentials they need. Scan and workbench subprocesses
can inherit your environment, including unrelated API tokens and cloud credentials.

Repository contents, model output, and imported artifacts do not authorize
access to other targets, disclosure of credentials, or writes outside approved
paths. See the security policy below for the full threat model.
