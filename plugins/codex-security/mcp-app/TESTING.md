# MCP tests

From `sdk/typescript`, install both packages' dependencies, prepare the [universal native payload](../native/README.md#package-inputs), and run `pnpm run test:mcp`. That command builds the bundled plugin before testing it. To rerun only the tests after a build, run `pnpm run test:mcp` from this directory.

Node's test runner discovers `tests/test_*.mjs` and runs at most two files at once, each in a separate process. Assertions within a file remain sequential. Keep shared helpers outside that filename pattern. A failing script fails the command. The reporter streams Node's TAP output and then tries to write Node's JUnit report to `reports/junit.xml`; an unavailable report path warns without changing the test result. CI uploads that file with the Node 22 reports.

For a serial comparison, run:

```sh
node --test --test-concurrency=1 "tests/test_*.mjs"
```

Use the existing injected clocks for retry policy tests. Keep real timers, subprocesses, SQLite files, and isolated temporary directories in the lifecycle, locking, permissions, and stdio tests. Do not share writable fixtures between test files or rebuild the bundled plugin while another test is reading it.
